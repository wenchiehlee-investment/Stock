Current and future portfolio holdings are subject to risk.  Investing in foreign securities involves 
additional risks beyond the risks of investing in U.S. securities markets.  These risks include 
currency fluctuations; political uncertainty; different accounting and financial standards; different 
regulatory environments; and different market and economic factors in various non-U.S. countries.  
In addition, the securities of small, less well known companies may be more volatile than those of 
larger companies.  Value investing involves the risk that the market will not recognize a security's 
intrinsic value for a long time, or that a security thought to be undervalued may actually be 
appropriately priced when purchased.  Please refer to the Funds’ prospectus for a description of 
risk factors associated with investments in securities that may be held by the Funds. 
 
Past performance is not a guarantee of future results, nor are the results in this booklet indicative of 
the past or future performance of the Funds or any separately managed account of Tweedy, Browne 
Company LLC.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an 
investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. 
 
The investment returns presented in the studies herein represent past performance of stocks and 
indices as outlined in the respective studies and should not be considered indicative or

Dear Investor: 
What Has Worked in Investing is an attempt to share with you our knowledge of 
historically successful investment characteristics and approaches. Included in this booklet 
are descriptions of over 50 studies, approximately half of which relate to non-U.S. stocks. 
Our choice of studies has not been selective; we merely included most of the major studies 
we have seen through the years. Interestingly, geography had no influence on the basic 
conclusion that stocks possessing the characteristics described in this booklet provided the 
best returns over long periods of time. While this conclusion comes as no surprise to us, it 
does provide empirical evidence that Benjamin Graham’s principles of investing, first 
described in 1934 in his book, Security Analysis, continue to serve investors well. A 
knowledge of the recurring and often interrelated patterns of investment success over long 
periods has not only enhanced our investment process, but has also provided long-term 
perspective and, occasionally, patience and perseverance. We hope this knowledge will also 
serve you well. 
The basic investment selection criteria described in What Has Worked in Investing have 
been incorporated in Tweedy, Browne’s investment screening and decision making process 
since at least 1958, when Tom Knapp, a retired partner, joined Tweedy, Browne from 
Benjamin Graham’s investment management firm, Graham-Newman Corporation. Most of 
Tweedy, Browne’s investments have had at least one, and, more frequently, several of the 
investment characteristics which are described in this booklet. 
The criteria and characteristics have been utilized by Tweedy, Browne because they 
pointed, like clues, in the direction of truly undervalued companies; appealed to common 
sense; and because the managing directors have always believed that undervaluation, which 
is associated with low risk, would also be associated with satisfactory returns. In addition to 
the confirmation provided by our own historical investment results spanning nearly 50 
years, the extensive studies described in this booklet, in our judgment, have empirically 
confirmed that the fundamental approach to security analysis developed by Benjamin 
Graham, and long practiced by Tweedy, Browne, produces attractive long-term rates of 
return. Most investments in Tweedy, Browne portfolios have had, and continue to have, at 
the time of purchase one or more of the following characteristics:

WHAT HAS WORKED IN INVESTING 
ii 
1. Low Price in Relation to Asset Value  Stocks priced at less than book value are 
purchased on the assumption that, in time, their market price will reflect at least their 
stated book value; i.e., what the company itself has paid for its own assets. From time 
to time, we also have been able to find stocks selling at discounts to net current 
assets (i.e., cash and other assets which can be turned into cash within one year, such 
as accounts receivable and inventory, less all liabilities), a measure of the estimated 
liquidation value of the business. This was a stock selection technique successfully 
employed by Benjamin Graham.  
2. Low Price in Relation to Earnings  Stocks bought at low price/earnings ratios 
afford higher earnings yields than stocks bought at higher ratios of price-to-earnings. 
The earnings yield is the yield which shareholders would receive if all the earnings 
were paid out as a dividend. Benjamin Graham recommended investing in companies 
whose earnings yield was 200% of the yield on AAA bonds. Investing in stocks that 
are priced low in relation to earnings does not preclude investments in companies 
whose earnings are expected to grow in the future. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, 
“value” and “growth” are joined at the hip. A company priced low in relation to 
earnings, whose earnings are expected to grow, is preferable to a similarly priced 
company whose earnings are not expected to grow. Price is the key. Included within 
this broad low price in relation to earnings category are 
high dividend yields and 
low prices in relation to cash flow (earnings plus depreciation expense).  
3. A Significant Pattern of Purchases by One or More Insiders 
(Officers and Directors)  Officers, directors and large shareholders often buy their 
own company’s stock when it is depressed in relation to the current value which 
would be ascribable to the company’s assets or its ongoing business in a corporate 
acquisition, or to the likely value of the company in the near to intermediate future. 
Insiders often have “insight information” — knowledge about new marketing 
programs, product price increases, cost cuts, increased order rates, changes in 
industry conditions, etc., which they believe will result in an increase in the true 
underlying value of the company. Other examples of insider insights are: knowledge 
of the true value of “hidden assets,” such as the value of a money-losing subsidiary 
which a competitor may have offered to buy, or the value of excess real estate not 
required in a company’s operation, or knowledge of the likely earning power of the 
company once heavy non-recurring new product development costs stop. It is not 
uncommon to see significant insider buying in companies selling in the stock market at

low price/earnings ratios or at low prices in relation to book value. Frequently, 
companies in which we have invested have also purchased their own shares in the 
open market.  
4. A Significant Decline in a Stock’s Price  A decline in price is often accompanied 
by a decline in earnings or an earnings disappointment. Reversion to the mean is 
almost a law of nature with respect to company performance. We have found that, 
more often than not, companies whose recent performance has been poor tend to 
perk up and improve.  
5. Small Market Capitalization  Since our investment process at Tweedy, Browne 
incorporates the entire universe of publicly traded companies, it is not surprising that 
our portfolios have held, and continue to have exposure to, smaller capitalization 
companies. Most publicly traded companies are small in terms of their market 
capitalization. Furthermore, these companies are often associated with higher rates of 
growth and may, due to their size, be more easily acquired by other corporations. 
It has not been uncommon for the investments in our portfolios to simultaneously possess 
many of the above characteristics. For instance, companies selling at low prices in relation 
to net current assets, book value and/or earnings are frequently priced low in relation to 
cash flow, have a high dividend yield and are smaller in terms of their market capitalization. 
More often than not, the stock price has declined significantly from prior levels; corporate 
officers and directors have been accumulating the company’s stock, and the company itself 
is engaged in a share repurchase program. Furthermore, these companies are often priced in 
the stock market at discounts to real world estimates of the value shareholders would 
receive in a sale or liquidation of the entire company. Each characteristic seems somewhat 
analogous to one piece of a mosaic. When several of the pieces are arranged together, the 
picture can be clearly seen: an undervalued stock.  
Dr. Josef Lakonishok (University of Illinois), Dr. Robert W. Vishny (University of Chicago) 
and Dr. Andrei Shleifer (Harvard University) presented a paper funded by the National 
Bureau of Economic Research entitled, “Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation and Risk,” 
May 1993, which examined investment returns from all companies listed on the New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) and American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in relation to ratios of 
price-to-book value, price-to-earnings and price-to-cash flow between 1968 and 1990. In 
their abstract, the authors state, “This paper provides evidence that value strategies yield 
higher returns because these strategies exploit the mistakes of the typical investor and not 
because these strategies are fundamentally riskier.”

A subsequent paper, interestingly co-authored by Burton G. Malkiel, the Princeton 
Professor and author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street, which argues against the 
efficacy of actively managed investment strategies in favor of index funds, investigated 
whether the predictable return advantages associated with contrarian strategies set forth in 
previous empirical studies was persistent and exploitable by investment managers.  In this 
study published in The Journal of Economics and Statistics (May 1997) entitled, “The 
Predictability of Stock Returns: A Cross-Sectional Simulation,” Zsuzsanna Fluck (New York 
University), Burton G. Malkiel (Princeton) and Richard E. Quandt (Princeton) examined 
the performance of 1,000 large-company stocks ranked by price/earnings ratios and price-
to-book value ratios from 1979 through 1995, and confirmed the findings of the previous 
Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny study, “Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation and Risk,” 
finding that,  
On a sample of large companies that is free from selection bias, we have concluded that 
the superior performance of contrarian strategies, documented by earlier studies is not 
simply an artifact of selection bias.  We have also found that the result is robust with 
respect to transaction costs. 
The papers by Fluck, Malkiel and Quandt, and by Lakonishok, Shliefer and Vishny, together 
with similar studies described in the “Assets Bought Cheap” and “Earnings Bought Cheap” 
sections of What Has Worked In Investing demonstrate that, at the extreme, investors 
overvalue and undervalue individual stocks, and that the best returns come from buying 
stocks at the extreme end of the value spectrum.

Benjamin Graham’s Net Current Asset Value Stock Selection Criterion 
The net current asset value approach is the oldest approach to investment in groups of 
securities with common selection characteristics of which we are aware. Benjamin Graham 
developed and tested this criterion between 1930 and 1932. The net current assets 
investment selection criterion calls for the purchase of stocks which are priced at 66% or 
less of a company's underlying current assets (cash, receivables and inventory) net of all 
liabilities and claims senior to a company’s common stock (current liabilities, long-term 
debt, preferred stock, unfunded pension liabilities).  For example, if a company's current 
assets are $100 per share and the sum of current liabilities, long-term debt, preferred stock, 
and unfunded pension liabilities is $40 per share, then net current assets would be $60 per 
share, and Graham would pay no more than 66% of $60, or $40, for this stock. Graham 
used the net current asset investment selection technique extensively in the operations of 
his investment management business, Graham-Newman Corporation, through 1956. 
Graham reported that the average return, over a 30-year period, on diversified portfolios of 
net current asset stocks was about 20% per year. 
In the 1973 edition of The Intelligent Investor, Benjamin Graham commented on the 
technique:  
“It always seemed, and still seems, ridiculously simple to say that if one can acquire a 
diversified group of common stocks at a price less than the applicable net current assets 
alone — after deducting all prior claims, and counting as zero the fixed and other assets 
— the results should be quite satisfactory.” 
In an article in the November/December 1986 issue of Financial Analysts Journal, “Ben 
Graham’s Net Current Asset Values: A Performance Update,” Henry Oppenheimer, an 
Associate Professor of Finance at the State University of New York at Binghamton, 
examined the investment results of stocks selling at or below 66% of net current asset value 
during the 13-year period from December 31, 1970 through December 31, 1983.  
The study assumed that all stocks meeting the investment criterion were purchased on 
December 31 of each year, held for one year, and replaced on December 31 of the 
subsequent year by stocks meeting the same criterion on that date. To create the annual net 
current asset portfolios, Oppenheimer screened the entire Standard & Poor’s Security 
Owners Guide. The entire 13-year study sample size was 645 net current asset selections 
from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) and 
the over-the-counter securities market. The minimum December 31 sample was 18 
companies and the maximum December 31 sample was 89 companies.

The mean return from net current asset stocks for the 13-year period was 29.4% per year 
versus 11.5% per year for the NYSE-AMEX Index. One million dollars invested in the net 
current asset portfolio on December 31, 1970 would have increased to $25,497,300 by 
December 31, 1983. By comparison, $1,000,000 invested in the NYSE-AMEX Index 
would have increased to $3,729,600 on December 31, 1983. The net current asset 
portfolio's exceptional performance over the entire 13 years was not consistent over smaller 
subsets of time within the 13-year period. For the three-year period, December 31, 1970 
through December 31, 1973, which represents 23% of the 13-year study period, the mean 
annual return from the net current asset portfolio was .6% per year as compared to 4.6% 
per year for the NYSE-AMEX Index.  
The study also examined the investment results from the net current asset companies which 
operated at a loss (about one-third of the entire sample of companies) as compared to the 
investment results of the net current asset companies which operated profitably. The 
companies operating at a loss had slightly higher investment returns than the companies 
with positive earnings: 31.3% per year for the unprofitable companies versus 28.9% per 
year for the profitable companies. 
Further research by Tweedy, Browne has indicated that companies satisfying the net current 
asset criterion have not only enjoyed good common stock performance over time but also 
have often been priced at significant discounts to “real world” estimates of the specific value 
that stockholders would probably receive in an actual sale or liquidation of the entire 
corporation. Net current asset value ascribes no value to a company's real estate and 
equipment, nor is any going concern value ascribed to prospective earning power from a 
company’s sales base. When liquidation value appraisals are made, the estimated “haircut” 
on accounts receivable and inventory is often recouped or exceeded by the estimated value 
of a company’s real estate and equipment. It is not uncommon to see informed investors, 
such as a company's own officers and directors or other corporations, accumulate the shares 
of a company priced in the stock market at less than 66% of net current asset value. The 
company itself is frequently a buyer of its own shares.  
Common characteristics associated with stocks selling at less than 66% of net current asset 
value are low price/earnings ratios, low price/sales ratios and low price in relation to 
“normal” earnings; i.e., what the company would earn if it earned the average return on 
equity for a given industry or the average net income margin on sales for such industry. 
Current earnings are often depressed in relation to prior earnings. The stock price has often 
declined significantly from prior price levels, causing a shrinkage in a company’s market 
capitalization. 
Note:  Investors should bear in mind that Ben Graham’s “66% of net current asset” 
criterion, which is discussed in several places in this paper, is a rather extreme quantitative 
value-based methodology that should not be confused with Tweedy, Browne’s current criteria 
of investing in businesses trading in the stock market at approximately 2/3rds or less of

estimated intrinsic value.  In general, “net current assets” is a quick approximation of the 
value of a company’s assets in liquidation, with no value ascribed to the company’s property, 
plant, equipment or its sales base.  For most companies, estimate of intrinsic value will be 
significantly in excess of net current asset value.  Ben Graham’s well known “66% of net 
current assets” formula has been of limited practical utility to value investors such as 
ourselves in recent years.  Stocks trading at 66% of net current assets or less have been few 
and far between in the stock market, and when we do uncover them, they are often micro-
capitalization companies that can accommodate only modest levels of investment.  That said, 
they do turn up from time to time, and when they do, we study them as prospective investment 
candidates. 
Low Price in Relation to Book Value 
Roger Ibbotson, Professor in the Practice of Finance at Yale School of Management and 
President of Ibbotson Associates, Inc., a consulting firm specializing in economics, 
investments and finance, in “Decile Portfolios of the New York Stock Exchange, 1967 - 
1984,” Working Paper, Yale School of Management, 1986, studied the relationship be-
tween stock price as a percentage of book value and investment returns. To test this 
relationship, all stocks listed on the NYSE were ranked on December 31 of each year, 
according to stock price as a percentage of book value, and sorted into deciles.  (A decile 
is 10% of the stocks listed on the NYSE.) The compound average annual returns were 
measured for each decile for the 18-year period, December 31, 1966 through 
December 31, 1984.  
As shown in Table 1, stocks with a low price-to-book value ratio had significantly better 
investment returns over the 18-year period than stocks priced high as a percentage of 
book value.

During the period December 31, 1966 through December 31, 1984 covered in Table 1, the 
compound annual return for the market capitalization weighted NYSE Index was 8.6%. 
Werner F.M. DeBondt and Richard H. Thaler, Finance Professors at University of 
Wisconsin and Cornell University, respectively, examined stock price in relation to book 
value in “Further Evidence on Investor Overreaction and Stock Market Seasonality,” The 
Journal of Finance, July 1987. All companies listed on the NYSE and AMEX, except 
companies that were part of the S&P 40 Financial Index, were ranked according to stock 
price in relation to book value and sorted into quintiles, five groups of equal number, on 
December 31 in each of 1969, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1977 and 1979.  The total number of 
companies in the entire sample ranged between 1,015 and 1,339 on each of the six 
portfolio formation dates.  
The investment return in excess of or (less than) the equal weighted NYSE Index was 
computed over the subsequent four years for all of the stocks in each selection period. The 
four-year returns in excess of or (less than) the market index were averaged. The study 
results and additional descriptive information are presented below in Table 2.

The compound annual return in excess of the market index from the lowest 20% of the 
stocks, in terms of price/book value, was 8.91%. For each $1,000,000 invested, the low 
price/book value stocks returned $407,000 more on average than the market index in each 
four-year period.  
The authors point out the investment return reversion which occurred in the periods 
examined in their study. The average cumulative return for lowest price/book value stocks 
in the four years prior to portfolio formation was 25.8 percentage points less than the 
market index. This group of companies, which had performed so poorly in the stock 
market, subsequently increased 40.7 percentage points more than the market index in the

four years after portfolio formation. The highest price/book value stocks, which had 
excellent investment results in the four years prior to portfolio formation (76.2 percentage 
points in excess of the market index), subsequently returned 1.3 percentage points less than 
the market index in the four years after portfolio formation. 
Another intriguing aspect of the study was the contrast between the earnings pattern of the 
companies in the lowest quintile of price/book value companies (average price/book value 
equaled .36) and in the highest quintile of price/book value companies (average price/book 
value equaled 3.42). (A quintile is 20% of the companies listed on the NYSE and AMEX.) 
Table 3 describes the average earnings per share for companies in the lowest and highest

In the three years prior to the selection date, companies in the lowest quintile of 
price/book value experienced a significant decline in earnings, and companies in the highest 
quintile of price/book value experienced a significant increase in earnings. In the fourth 
year after the date of selection, the companies with the lowest price/book value 
experienced a larger percentage increase in earnings, +24.4%, than the companies with the 
highest price/book value, whose earnings increased 8.2%. The authors suggest that 
earnings are “mean reverting” at the extremes; i.e., that significant declines in earnings are 
followed by significant earnings increases, and that significant earnings increases are 
followed by slower rates of increase or declines.  
 
Tweedy, Browne examined the historical returns from stocks which were priced low in 
relation to book value and from stocks which were selling at 66% or less of net current 
asset value. All 7,000 public companies in the Compustat database, including the Research 
File of companies which had been acquired, merged or declared bankrupt subsequent to an 
assumed historical selection date, were screened to identify those companies with a market 
capitalization of at least $1 million and a stock market price of no more than 140% of book 
value on April 30 in each of 1970 through 1981. For each of these twelve portfolio 
formation dates, the investment returns for all stocks were computed for 6 months, 1 year,

2 years and 3 years after each selection date. These stocks were ranked according to price in 
relation to book value and sorted into nine price/book value groups and one group 
comprised of stocks selling at less than 66% of net current asset value. The average results 
for all stocks in each of the ten groups were compared to the results of the Standard & 
Poor’s 500 Stock Index (S&P 500) over each of the holding periods. A total of 1,820 
companies were culled from the Compustat database.  The results of this price/book value 
and net current asset value study are presented in Table 4.

One million dollars invested on April 30, 1970 and rolled over at each subsequent April 30 
into the stocks selling at less than 30% of book value would have increased to $23,298,000 
on April 30, 1982. One million dollars invested in the S&P 500 on April 30, 1970 would 
have been worth $2,662,000 on April 30, 1982.  
Tweedy, Browne, using the same methodology over the same period, examined the 
historical returns of the stocks of (i) unleveraged companies which were priced low in 
relation to book value and (ii) unleveraged companies selling at 66% or less of net current 
asset value in the stock market. The sample included only those companies priced at no 
more than 140% of book value, or no more than 66% of net current asset value in which 
the debt-to-equity ratio was 20% or less. The results of this study of unleveraged companies 
which were priced low in relation to book value and net current asset value are presented 
on the following page in Table 5.

The results for the unleveraged companies were somewhat better than the investment 
results for the companies in which debt-to-equity exceeded 20%.  
Similar to net current asset stocks, other characteristics frequently associated with stocks 
selling at low ratios of price-to-book value are: (i) low price-to-earnings ratios, (ii) low 
price-to-sales ratios, and (iii) low price in relation to “normal” earnings, assuming a 
company earns the average return on equity for a given industry or the average net income 
margin on sales for such industry. Current earnings are often depressed in relation to prior 
levels of earnings. The stock price has often declined significantly from prior levels. The 
companies with the lowest ratios of price-to-book value are generally smaller market 
capitalization companies. Corporate officers and directors often buy such stock because they 
believe it is depressed relative to its true value. The companies also frequently repurchase 
their own stock.  
In Tweedy, Browne’s experience, stocks selling at low prices in relation to book value are 
often priced at significant discounts to “real world” estimates of the value that shareholders 
would receive in a sale of the entire company. By real world estimates, we mean estimates 
made by individuals familiar with corporate valuation in the company's field of business.

Small Market Capitalization Low Price-to-Book Value Companies as Compared to 
Large Capitalization Low Price-to-Book Value Companies 
Eugene L. Fama and Kenneth R. French examined the effects of market capitalization and 
price as a percentage of book value on investment returns in “The Cross-Section of 
Expected Stock Returns,” Working Paper 333, Graduate School of Business, University of 
Chicago, January 1992. All non-financial NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ companies included 
in the Center for Research in Security Prices file for which data was also available in the 
Compustat database were ranked according to stock price as a percentage of book value and 
sorted into deciles. Then, each price/book value decile was ranked according to market 
capitalization and sorted into deciles. The study examined investment returns from July 
1963 to December 1990. Average annual equal-weighted investment returns for each of the 
ten market capitalization deciles which comprised each of the ten price/book value deciles 
are presented below in Table 6.

As Table 6 indicates, smaller market capitalization companies at the lowest prices in 
relation to book value provided the best returns. Table 6 also shows that within every 
market capitalization category, the best returns were produced by stocks with low prices in 
relation to book value.

In addition, the authors, through a regression analysis, examined the power of the following 
characteristics to predict future investment returns: market beta, market capitalization, 
price/earnings ratio, leverage and price-to-book value percentage. Their conclusion: price-
to-book value “is consistently the most powerful for explaining the cross-section of average 
stock returns.” 
Five-Year Holding Period Year-by-Year Investment Returns for Low Price-to-Book 
Value Companies as Compared to High Price-to-Book Value Companies  
Josef Lakonishok, Robert W. Vishny and Andrei Shleifer examined the effect of price as a 
percentage of book value on investment returns in “Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation 
and Risk,” Working Paper No. 4360, National Bureau of Economic Research, May 1993. 
The professors ranked all companies listed on the NYSE and the AMEX according to 
stock price as a percentage of book value and sorted the companies into deciles.  Portfolios 
were initially formed on April 30, 1968, and new portfolios were formed on each 
subsequent April 30. The study period ended on April 30, 1990. The decile portfolios 
were held for five years, and the average annual year-by-year investment returns, the 
average annual five-year returns and the average cumulative total five-year returns were 
calculated. The investment returns were equal-weighted. The following Table 7 shows the 
results of the study.

The Consistency of Returns for Low Price-to-Book Value Companies as Compared to 
High Price-to-Book Value Companies 
The study which was described in the preceding section, “Contrarian Investment, 
Extrapolation and Risk,” also examined the consistency of investment returns for low price-
to-book value companies as compared to high price-to-book value companies over l-year, 
3-year and 5-year holding periods from April 30, 1968 through April 30, 1990. The 
investment returns for the companies in the high price-to-book value category, which 
comprised the returns for the companies in the highest two deciles of companies which had 
been ranked on price-to-book value, were subtracted from the investment returns of the 
low price-to-book value companies, which comprised the bottom two deciles of the price-
to-book value ranking. The following Table 8 shows the results of the study.

As Table 8 indicates, the low price-to-book value stocks outperformed the high price-to-
book value stocks in 16 of the 22 years, or 73% of the time. For three-year holding periods, 
the low price-to-book companies beat high price-to-book companies in 18 out of the 20 
three-year periods. For five-year holding periods, the low price-to-book value companies 
were a better choice than the high price-to-book value companies every time.  
Are Low Price-to-Book Value Stocks' Higher Returns, as Compared to High 
Price-to-Book Value Stocks, due to Higher Risk?  
In an attempt to examine whether the higher returns of low price-to-book value stocks 
were due to greater risk, Professors Lakonishok, Vishny and Shleifer measured monthly 
investment returns in relation to price as a percentage of book value between April 30, 
1968 and April 30, 1990 in the 25 worst months for the stock market, and the remaining 
88 months in which the stock market declined. In addition, monthly returns were ex-
amined in the 25 best months for the stock market and the 122 remaining months in 
which the stock market increased. The results of this study are shown below in Table 9.

As Table 9 indicates, the low price-to-book value stocks outperformed the high price-to-
book value stocks in the market's worst 25 months, and in the other 88 months when the 
market declined. In the best 25 months for the market, the low price-to-book value stocks 
also beat the high price-to-book value stocks. The monthly results were similar for both 
high and low price-to-book value stocks in the remaining 122 months when the stock 
market increased.  
The professors conclude,  
Overall, the value strategy [low price-to-book value] appears to do somewhat better 
than the glamour strategy [high price-to-book value] in all states and significantly 
better in some states. If anything, the superior performance of the value strategy is

skewed toward negative return months rather than positive return months. The 
evidence [in Table 9] thus shows that the value strategy does not expose investors to 
greater downside risk. 
Low Price-to-Book Value Stocks Yield Sizeable Excess Returns 
Net of Transaction Expenses 
In a study published in The Journal of Economics and Statistics (May 1997) entitled, 
“The Predictability of Stock Returns: A Cross-Sectional Simulation,” Zsuzsanna Fluck (New 
York University), Burton G. Malkiel (Princeton) and Richard E. Quandt (Princeton) 
examined the performance of 1,000 large-company stocks ranked by price/earnings and 
price-to-book value ratios from 1979 through 1995, and confirmed the findings of the 
previous Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny study, “Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation and 
Risk,” finding that low price/earnings and low price-to-book value strategies yield sizeable 
excess returns net of transaction costs and after adjusting for risk. 
In Table 10, Fluck, Malkiel and Quandt constructed a data sample from Compustat for the 
period January 1989 through mid-1995 consisting of the 1,000 largest U.S. companies as of 
1988, sorted and ranked into deciles based on their prices in relation to book value.  They 
found that the lowest price-to-book value decile, which was rebalanced quarterly, produced 
1.89% of excess return quarterly, or 7.56% annualized, over the average return produced by 
the entire data sample.  This translated into an average annual return for the low price-to-book 
value decile of 23.96% versus a 16.40% average annual return for the entire Compustat 
sample.  In addition, they found that the excess return persisted even after performing 
portfolio simulations which took into consideration transaction expenses associated with 
purchases and sales.  The low price-to-book value decile produced returns annually that were 
5.2% better than the sample and 8.0% better than the S&P 500 net of transaction expenses.

Companies Throughout the World:  Low Price in Relation to Book Value 
In “Ben Graham Would be Proud,” a Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. research report dated April 
8, 1991, Barton M. Biggs, then a managing director of Morgan Stanley, described a study 
which examined the returns from investing in the stocks of non-U.S. and U.S. companies 
trading at low prices in relation to book value. In the study, all stocks in the Morgan Stanley 
Capital International database were ranked according to stock price in relation to book 
value and sorted into deciles each year from 1981 through 1990, a total of ten years. 
Approximately 80% of the companies in the Morgan Stanley Capital International database 
were non-U.S. companies. The number of companies in the analysis increased from 1,178 
to 2,349 over the period. The average investment return for the companies included in each 
price/book value group was compared to the return for the Morgan Stanley Capital 
International global equity index. The investment returns were equally weighted and 
expressed in U.S. dollars. Table 11 shows the results by year.

Companies in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan Trading at 
Low Prices in Relation to Book Value 
John R. Chisholm examined price-to-book value and investment results for companies in 
the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan in “Quantitative Applications for 
Research Analysts,” Investing Worldwide II, Association for Investment Management and 
Research, 1991. Companies in each country were ranked according to the ratio of price-to-
book value at the end of each year and sorted into five equal number groups (quintiles). The 
study period was December 31, 1974 through December 31, 1989 (15 years). Equal 
investments were assumed to have been made in each stock, and the stocks were assumed 
to have been sold after one year. The results were U.S. dollar results. Table 12 below 
shows the annual compound returns for the top and bottom quintiles.

Low Price-to-Book Value Stocks Compared to High Price-to-Book Value Stocks in 
France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States 
William F. Sharpe, a Nobel Prize winner in economics, and Carlo Capaul and Ian Rowley, 
from Union Bank of Switzerland, examined the comparative investment returns of low 
price-to-book value stocks (“value” stocks) and high price-to-book value stocks (“growth” 
stocks) in France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United 
States in “International Value and Growth Stock Returns,” Financial Analysts Journal, 
January/February 1993. Each six months, the stocks, which comprised a major index in 
each country, were ranked on the ratio of price-to-book value. The S&P 500 was used for 
the United States, and Morgan Stanley Capital International indexes were used for the other 
countries. Within each country, the highest price-to-book value stocks, whose total market 
capitalizations accounted for 50% of the entire market capitalization of the particular 
country's index, were defined as the growth stock portfolio. The lower price-to-book value 
stocks which, in aggregate, accounted for the remaining 50% of the entire market 
capitalization of the index were defined as the value portfolio. The monthly return for each

of the two portfolios was the market capitalization weighted average of the total returns on 
the underlying stocks. The cumulative difference between the investment returns of the 
value stocks and the growth stocks in each country over the 11½-year period, January 1981 
through June 1992, are shown in Table 13.

The study’s authors concluded “Value stocks outperformed growth stocks on average in 
each country during the period studied, both absolutely and after adjustment for risk.”

Low Price in Relation to Earnings 
Sanjoy Basu, Professor of Finance at McMaster University, examined price/earnings ratios 
and investment results in “Investment Performance of Common Stocks in Relation to Their 
Price/Earnings Ratios: A Test of the Efficient Market Hypothesis,” Journal of Finance, 
June 1977. His study covered NYSE listed companies, about 500 stocks annually, over a 14-
year period, from 1957 through 1971. The price/earnings ratios for all the stocks were 
calculated at year end, ranked from highest to lowest price/earnings ratios, and sorted into 
quintiles. The study assumed that equal investments were made in each stock, and that the 
stocks were sold after one year. The results are shown on the following page in Table 14. 
Portfolio 1, the highest price/earnings ratio group, includes all companies with losses. 
Portfolio 2 is the same group of stocks as Portfolio 1, except the companies with losses 
have been excluded.

Roger Ibbotson, in his “Decile Portfolios of the NYSE, 1967 – 1984,” Working Paper, Yale 
School of Management, 1986, ranked all stocks listed on the NYSE according to 
price/earnings ratios on each December 31 from 1966 through 1983, and sorted the stocks 
into deciles. The investment returns were measured for each year from December 31, 1966 
through December 31, 1984, an 18-year period. The results are shown below in Table 15.

During the 18-year period shown in Table 15, the compound annual returns for the market 
capitalization weighted NYSE and U.S. Treasury bills were 8.6% and 7.4%, respectively.  
In Tweedy, Browne’s experience, stocks selling at low prices in relation to earnings are 
also often significantly undervalued in relation to specific appraisals of the value that 
shareholders would receive in a sale of the entire company, based upon valuations of similar 
businesses in corporate transactions. Companies with low price/earnings ratios are also 
frequently priced at low price-to-book value ratios relative to other companies in the 
same industry.  
Stocks of companies selling at low price/earnings ratios often have above-average cash 
dividend yields. Additionally, the remaining part of earnings after the payment of cash 
dividends, i.e., retained earnings, are reinvested in the business for the benefit of the 
shareholders. Retained earnings increase the net assets, or stockholders’ equity, of a 
company. The increase in stockholders' equity from retained earnings often equates to a 
specific increase in the true corporate value of a company, especially when the retained 
earnings result in a similar increase in a company's cash or a decrease in its debt. 
Reinvestment of retained earnings in business assets and projects which earn high returns 
can increase true corporate value by amounts exceeding the actual retained earnings. A 
company with a low price/earnings ratio, by definition, must provide the investor with 
either an above-average cash dividend yield, or an above-average retained earnings yield, or 
both. Similar to stocks selling at low prices in relation to net current asset value and book 
value, the shares of a company with a low price/earnings ratio are often accumulated by the 
officers and directors, or by the company itself. The company’s stock price has frequently 
declined significantly.  
Benjamin Graham’s Low Price/Earnings Ratio Stock Selection Criteria 
Henry Oppenheimer, in “A Test of Ben Graham's Stock Selection Criteria,” Financial 
Analysts Journal, September/October 1984, examined the investment performance of 
the low price/earnings ratio stock selection criteria developed by Benjamin Graham. 
Benjamin Graham's stock selection criteria called for the purchase of securities of companies 
in which the earnings yield (i.e., the reciprocal of the price/earnings ratio) was at least 
twice the AAA bond yield, and the company's total debt (i.e., current liabilities and long-
term debt) was less than its book value. Graham also advised that each security which met 
the selection criteria be held for either two years, or until 50% price appreciation occurred, 
whichever came first.

Henry Oppenheimer screened securities listed on the New York and AMEX to select those 
issues that met Graham's criteria on each March 31 from 1974 through 1980. An investor 
who had employed Graham's criteria during this period achieved a mean annual return of 
38% as compared to 14% per year, including dividends, from the market index (Center for 
Research in Securities Prices’ (CRSP) index of NYSE-AMEX securities). Table 16 shows 
the study results by holding period.

Sanjoy Basu examined the effects of market capitalization and price/earnings ratios on 
investment returns in “The Relationship Between Earnings Yield, Market Value and Return 
for NYSE Common Stocks,” Journal of Financial Economics, December 1983. Professor 
Basu ranked all companies listed on the NYSE according to price/earnings ratios and sorted 
the companies into quintiles. Then, each quintile was ranked according to market 
capitalization and sorted into sub-quintiles within each of the price/earnings ratio groups. 
This process occurred as of each April 30 from 1963 through 1980 (a 17-year period ended 
April 30, 1980) and the annual investment returns were computed. Table 17, on the 
following page, shows the results of this study.

One million dollars invested in the smallest fifth of the companies listed on the NYSE, 
which were priced in the bottom fifth in terms of price/earnings ratios, would have 
increased to $19,500,000 over the 17-year study period. By comparison, $1,000,000 
invested in the largest market capitalization stocks with the lowest price/earnings ratios 
would have increased to $8,107,000 over the same period. During the period, the annual 
investment returns for the market capitalization weighted and equal weighted NYSE 
indexes were 7.68% and 12.12%, respectively. One million dollars invested in the market 
capitalization weighted and equal weighted NYSE indexes would have increased to 
$3,518,000 and $6,992,000, respectively.  
 
 
Dreman Value Management, L.P., in conjunction with Professor Michael Berry of James 
Madison University, examined the relationship between market capitalizations, 
price/earnings ratios and annual investment returns over a 20½-year period ended 
October 31, 1989. Each year, all companies in the Compustat database (approximately 
6,000 companies during this period) were ranked according to market capitalization and 
sorted into quintiles. Then, the stocks within each market capitalization quintile were 
ranked according to price/earnings ratios and sorted into sub-quintiles. The investment 
return over the following year was calculated for each stock. The average annual investment 
returns are presented on the following page in Table 18.

One million dollars invested in the lowest price/earnings ratio companies within the lowest 
market capitalization group in 1969 would have increased to $29,756,500 on October 31, 
1989. By comparison, $1,000,000 invested in the highest price/earnings ratio companies 
within the smallest market capitalization group would have increased to $2,279,000 over 
this 20½-year period. One million dollars invested in the largest market capitalization, 
lowest price/earnings ratio group over this period would have increased to $12,272,000.

Josef Lakonishok, Robert W. Vishny and Andrei Shleifer examined the effect of 
price/earnings ratios on investment returns in “Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation and 
Risk,” Working Paper No. 4360, National Bureau of Economic Research, May 1993. 
The professors ranked all companies listed on the NYSE and the AMEX according to 
stock price/earnings ratios and sorted the companies into deciles.  Portfolios were initially 
formed on April 30, 1968, and new portfolios were formed on each subsequent April 30. 
The study period ended on April 30, 1990. The decile portfolios were held for five years, 
and the average annual year-by-year investment returns, the average annual five-year returns 
and the average cumulative total five-year returns were calculated. The investment returns 
were equal-weighted. Table 19, on the following page, shows the results of the study.

Low Price/Earnings Ratio Stocks Yield Sizeable Excess Returns 
Net of Transaction Expenses 
In a study published in The Journal of Economics and Statistics (May 1997) entitled, “The 
Predictability of Stock Returns: A Cross-Sectional Simulation,” Zsuzsanna Fluck (New York 
University), Burton G. Malkiel (Princeton) and Richard E. Quandt (Princeton) examined the 
performance of 1,000 large-company stocks ranked by price/earnings and price-to-book value 
ratios from 1979 through 1995, and confirmed the findings of the previous Lakonishok, Shleifer 
and Vishny study, “Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation and Risk,” finding that low 
price/earnings and low price-to-book value strategies yield sizeable excess returns net of 
transaction costs and after adjusting for risk. 
As shown in Table 20, Fluck, Malkiel and Quandt constructed a data sample from Compustat 
for the period mid-1979 through 1988 and for the period between 1989 through mid-1995 
consisting of the 1,000 largest U.S. companies sorted and ranked into deciles based on their 
prices in relation to earnings.  They found for the period mid-1979 through 1988 that the 
lowest price/earnings ratio decile, which was rebalanced quarterly, produced 1.82% of excess 
return quarterly, or 7.28% annualized, over the average return of the entire data sample.  This 
translated into an annual return for the low price/earnings ratio decile of 25.28% versus 
18.00% for the Compustat sample.  Conducting the same study for the period 1989 through 
mid-1995 produced similar results with the low price/earnings ratio decile producing returns 
that were 1% better than the sample per quarter, or 4% annualized, for an annual return of

20.4% for the low price/earnings ratio decile versus 16.4% for the sample.  In addition, they 
found that the excess return persisted even after performing portfolio simulations which took 
into consideration transaction expenses associated with purchases and sales.  The low 
price/earnings ratio decile for the periods 6/1979 – 12/1988 and 1/1989 – 6/1995 produced 
returns annually that were 5.6% and 1.6% better, respectively, than the sample and 8.4% and 
4.4% better, respectively, than the S&P 500, net of transaction expenses.

Applications for Research Analysts,” Investing Worldwide II, Association for Investment 
Management and Research, 1991. A data set, which was described as being comprised of 
fairly liquid, buyable companies, was ranked at the end of each year according to 
price/earnings ratios and sorted into quintiles. The study period was December 31, 1974 
through December 31, 1989 (15 years). Equal investments were assumed to have been 
made in each stock, and the stocks were assumed to have been sold after one year. The 
results were U.S. dollar results. Table 21, on the following page, shows the annual

Mario Levis, Professor at the School of Management, University of Bath, United Kingdom, 
examined the association between price in relation to earnings, and investment returns 
from April 1961 through March 1985 in “Market Size, PE Ratios, Dividend Yield and Share 
Prices: The UK Evidence.” Using the London Share Price Database, the companies for 
which earnings information was available were ranked according to price/earnings ratios on 
each April 1 from 1961 through 1985 and sorted into quintiles. The annual investment 
returns and the cumulative value of £1 million invested throughout the 24-year period in

price/earnings ratios within each stock's respective industry in their book, Hyper-Profits, 
Doubleday & Company, 1985. The authors ranked the stocks in each of more than one 
hundred industries according to price/earnings ratios within the particular industry itself, 
and sorted these companies within each industry into five quintiles based on price/earnings 
ratios. At the end of each year, this procedure was repeated. The test period was 1962 
through 1980, and 2,600 companies were examined in each of the years. Table 23 on the 
following page shows the annual investment returns for the five groups, and the cumulative 
return from this approach.

One million dollars invested over the 18-year period, from 1962 through 1980, in 
companies with the lowest price/earnings ratios relative to the price/earnings ratios of 
other companies in the same industry, would have increased to $45,390,000. Over the 
same period, $1,000,000 invested in companies with the highest price/earnings ratios 
relative to the other companies in the same industry would have increased to $2,600,000.  
Companies Throughout the World: Low Price in Relation to Cash Flow 
A. Michael Keppler examined the relationship between price-to-cash flow ratios and 
investment returns for companies throughout the world in “Further Evidence on the 
Predictability of International Equity Returns: The Importance of Cash Flow in Country 
Selection,” Journal of Portfolio Management, Fall, 1991. Mr. Keppler's study assumed 
an equal weighted investment each quarter in each of the following eighteen Morgan 
Stanley Capital International national equity indexes over the nineteen years and eleven 
months period from January 31, 1970 through December 31, 1989: Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, 
Norway, Singapore/Malaysia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States.  Each quarter, the country indexes were ranked according to the ratio of 
price-to-cash flow and sorted into four quartiles (a quartile is 25% of the country indexes). 
The total investment return was measured for each of the four quartile groups over the 
subsequent three months. Cash flow was defined as net earnings after tax, minority 
interests, dividends on preferred stock, and distributions to employees, plus reported 
depreciation on fixed assets for the latest available twelve-month period.  
The study indicated that the most profitable strategy was investment in the lowest price-to-
cash flow quartile. This strategy produced a 19.17% compound annual return in local 
currencies (and 20.32% in U.S. dollars) over the January 31, 1970 through December 31, 
1989 period. The least profitable strategy was investment in the highest price-to-cash flow

25 
quartile, which produced a 4.37% compound annual return in local currencies (and 5.63% 
in U.S. dollars). The comparable return over the January 31, 1970 through December 31, 
1989 period for the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (MSCI World 
Index) was 12.45% in local currencies (and 13.58% in U.S. dollars).  
In Tweedy, Browne's experience, stocks selling at low prices in relation to cash flow are 
also often priced low in relation to book value and earnings, and often have high dividend 
yields. Business people in certain fields, such as the newspaper, cable television, 
broadcasting, and book and magazine publishing fields, frequently describe valuations of 
debt-free businesses in these fields in terms of multiples of pre-tax operating cash flow (pre-
tax income from the business itself before the deduction of depreciation). Stocks selling at 
low prices in relation to cash flow, especially in comparison to other companies in the same 
industry, are frequently undervalued relative to the price which shareholders would receive 
if the entire company were sold.  
For companies domiciled outside the United States, Tweedy, Browne has frequently 
observed depreciation policies that result in larger depreciation expenses, and lower 
earnings, than would be the case if the same company prepared its financial statements in 
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Swiss company, 
Nestle, for example, reports as an asset on its balance sheet the estimated current cost to 
replace its property, plant and equipment. This is a significantly larger figure than the 
historical cost figure which would be required under U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles (“GAAP”), and results in higher depreciation charges versus U.S. GAAP.  
Cash flow analysis and comparison to companies in the same industry will frequently 
suggest “hidden value” in the form of understated earnings and/or assets that have been 
written off to amounts which are significantly less than true realizable values.  
Five-Year Holding Period Year-by-Year Investment Returns for Low Price-to-Cash 
Flow Companies as Compared to High Price-to-Cash Flow Companies  
Josef Lakonishok, Robert W. Vishny and Andrei Shleifer examined the effect of price/cash 
flow ratios on investment returns in “Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation and Risk,” 
Working Paper No. 4360, National Bureau of Economic Research, May 1993. The 
professors ranked all companies listed on the NYSE and the AMEX according to price/cash 
flow of ratios and sorted the companies into deciles. Portfolios were initially formed on 
April 30, 1968, and new portfolios were formed on each subsequent April 30. The study 
period ended on April 30, 1990. The decile portfolios were held for five years, and the 
average annual year-by-year investment returns, the average annual five-year returns and 
the average cumulative total five-year returns were calculated. The investment returns 
were equal-weighted. Table 24 on the following page shows the results of the study.

The Consistency of Returns for Low Price-to-Cash Flow Companies as Compared to

The study which was described in the preceding section, “Contrarian Investment, 
Extrapolation and Risk,” also examined the consistency of investment returns for low price-
to-cash flow companies as compared to high price-to-cash flow companies over l-year, 
3-year and 5-year holding periods from April 30, 1968 through April 30, 1990. The 
investment returns for the companies in the high price-to-cash flow category, which 
comprised the returns for the companies in the highest two deciles of companies that had 
been ranked on price-to-cash flow, were subtracted from the investment returns of the low 
price-to-cash flow companies, which comprised the bottom two deciles of the price-to-cash 
flow ranking. Table 25 on the following page shows the results of the study.

the low price-to-cash flow companies beat high price-to-cash flow companies in 18 out of 
the 20 three-year periods. For five-year holding periods, the low price-to-cash flow 
companies were a better choice than the high price-to-cash flow companies every time.

Are Higher Returns of Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks, as Compared to 
High Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks, Due to Higher Risk?  
In an attempt to examine whether the higher returns of low price-to-cash flow stocks were 
due to greater risk, Professors Lakonishok, Vishny and Shleifer measured monthly 
investment returns in relation to price-to-cash flow between April 30, 1968 and April 30, 
1990 in the 25 worst months for the stock market, and the remaining 88 months in which 
the stock market declined. In addition, monthly returns were examined in the 25 best 
months for the stock market and the 122 remaining months in which the stock market 
increased. The results of this study are shown below in Table 26.

As Table 26 indicates, the low price-to-cash flow stocks outperformed the high price-to-cash 
flow stocks in the market's worst 25 months, and in the other 88 months when the market 
declined. In the best 25 months for the market, the low price-to-cash flow stocks also beat 
the high price-to-cash flow stocks. The monthly results were similar for both high and low 
price-to-cash flow stocks in the remaining 122 months when the stock market increased.  
The professors conclude, 
Overall, the value strategy [low price-to-cash flow] appears to do somewhat better than 
the glamour strategy [high price-to-cash flow] in all states and significantly better in some 
states. If anything, the superior performance of the value strategy is skewed toward 
negative return months rather than positive return months. The evidence [in Table 26] 
thus shows that the value strategy does not expose investors to greater downside risk.

The Performance of Value Portfolios Versus Growth Portfolios Revisited through 2001 
In their article entitled, “Value and Growth Investing: Review and Update,” Financial 
Analysts Journal, Vol. 60, No. 1, pp. 71-86, January/February 2004, Louis K.C. Chan 
and Josef Lakonishok reviewed and updated the literature regarding the performance of 
value versus growth strategies through 2001 and provided some new results based on an 
updated and expanded sample.  They found that even after taking into account the 
experience of the technology led stock markets of the late 1990s, value stocks generated 
superior returns.  They further concluded that common measures of risk do not support the 
argument that the return differential is a result of the higher riskiness of value stocks, but 
rather, in their opinion, is due to behavioral considerations and the agency costs of 
delegated investment management. 
In their paper, Chan and Lakonishok constructed large cap and small cap portfolios, based on 
NYSE breakpoints, at every calendar year-end between 1969 and 2001, by sorting stocks on a 
composite value indicator and placing them in 1 of 10 deciles.  The composite indicator 
pooled information from several valuation measures, including book value-to-price, cash 
flow-to-price, earnings-to-price and sales-to-price ratios in an effort to improve identification 
of stocks that were undervalued relative to their fundamentals.  As shown in Table 27, buy 
and hold returns for the year following portfolio formation were reported for the top two 
deciles - glamour (growth) portfolios - and for the bottom two deciles (value portfolios).

From 1979 through 2001, the geometric mean return on the value portfolio (decile 10) for 
large cap stocks exceeded the Russell 1000 Value Index over the same period by 500 basis 
points annualized.  In the small cap study, the deep value portfolio outperformed the 
Russell 2000 Value Index by 680 basis points annualized.

In the large cap study, the return differential between the average returns for the top two 
deciles (growth) and the bottom two deciles (value) was 1,004 basis points in favor of the 
value portfolio.  It was even more pronounced in the small cap study where the value 
deciles outperformed the growth deciles by 1,880 basis points annualized over the full 22-
year period. 
In the following Table 28, using a sample consisting of the largest cap stocks in the Morgan 
Stanley Country Index - Europe, Australasia, Far East (MSCI EAFE) of developed non-U.S. 
countries, Chan and Lakonishok used this same composite value indicator methodology to 
see whether these findings would hold for developed markets outside the U.S. during the 
period 1989 through 2001.  In parallel with the U.S. experience, the value deciles 
significantly outperformed both the MSCI EAFE Index and the growth deciles.

A report which describes Professor Levis’ dividend yield study, “Market Anomalies:  Are 
They a Mirage Or a Bona Fide Way to Enhance Portfolio Returns?” by Michael Lenhoff, 
January 19, 1990, notes that, 
there is a near perfect inverse correlation between the ratio of price to net asset value 
[i.e., book value] for the U.K. equity market and yield. When price stands significantly at 
a discount [premium] to the net asset value, the yield available from U.K. plc is 
significantly above [below] the long run range. 
Mr. Lenhoff also notes that the price/earnings ratio of high dividend yield companies are 
usually low in relation to the price/earnings ratio of the entire stock market and that the 
high yield companies are often takeover candidates.  
In Tweedy, Browne’s experience, high dividend yield on stocks in the U.K. and throughout 
the world is often associated with stocks selling at low prices in relation to earnings, book 
value and specific appraisals of the value that shareholders would receive in a sale of the 
entire company based upon valuations of similar businesses in corporate transactions.

Companies Throughout the World: High Dividend Yield 
In “The Importance of Dividend Yields in Country Selection,” The Journal of Portfolio 
Management, Winter 1991, A. Michael Keppler examined the relationship between 
dividend yield and investment returns for companies throughout the world.  Mr. Keppler’s 
study assumed an equal-weighted investment each quarter in each of the following eighteen 
Morgan Stanley Capital International equity indexes over the 20-year period, December 31, 
1969 through December 31, 1989: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Singapore/Malaysia, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  Each quarter, the 
country indexes were ranked according to dividend yield and sorted into four quartiles.  
The total investment return was measured for each of the four quartile groups over the 
subsequent three months. 
The study indicated that the most profitable strategy was investment in the highest yield 
quartile.  The compound annual investment return for the countries with the highest 
yielding stocks was 18.49% in local currencies (and 19.08% in U.S. dollars) over the 20-
year period, December 31, 1969 through December 31, 1989.  The least profitable strategy 
was investment in the lowest yield quartile, which produced a 5.74% compound annual 
return in local currency (and 10.31% in U.S. dollars).  The MSCI World Index return over 
the same period was 12.14% in local currency (and 13.26% in U.S. dollars).  On an equal-
weighted basis, the MSCI World Index was up 15.5% for the period in local currency.

High Dividend Yield Stocks Generally Outperform Those with Lower Yields, 
However, the Best Returns Have Not Come from those with the Highest Yields. 
Higher Yields Coupled with Low Payout Ratios Have Produced the Best Returns. 
In their equity research paper, entitled “High Yield, Low Payout,” Credit Suisse 
Quantitative Equity Research, August 15, 2006, Credit Suisse analysts Pankaj N. Patel, 
Souheang Yao and Heath Barefoot found that while high dividend yield stocks did indeed 
outperform their lower yield counterparts, the highest yield stocks were not the overall 
leaders in terms of return.  They ran a simulation of a dividend strategy from January 1980 
to June 2006, limiting their universe to stocks within the S&P 500.  They created equal-
weighted decile baskets based on dividend yields as of each month-end.  Over the 26-year 
period, they found that stocks with higher dividend yields generally outperformed those 
with low dividend yields, but the highest yield decile did not produce the best overall 
return.  As their chart below indicates, deciles 8 and 9 outperformed decile 10, the 
highest yield decile. 
 
 
 
In addition, they found within the higher dividend yield universe a direct correlation 
between low payout ratios and higher returns.  Specifically, they created three dividend 
yield baskets ranked by yield; i.e., high yield, low yield and no yield. Then, within each of 
these baskets they categorized stocks based on payout ratio; i.e., high, medium and low.  
Equal-weighted portfolios of these baskets were created based on dividend yields and 
payout ratios as of each quarter end for the period January 1990 to June 2006; i.e., high 
yield, low payout; low yield, low payout; low yield, high payout, etc. …  The stocks used

were those of the S&P 500.  As you can see from the chart that follows, the basket with the 
highest yields combined with low payout ratios produced the best returns.  The high yield, 
low payout portfolio bucket generated an annualized return for the period of 19.2% versus 
11.16% for the S&P 500.  Arithmetically, the lower the payout ratio associated with a given 
level of dividend yield, the higher the earnings yield for the company, and the cheaper the 
stock based on price-to-earnings multiples.  The high yield, low payout stocks that 
produced the better returns were priced at low ratios of price-to-earnings, and as a 
corollary, at high ratios of earnings-to-price; i.e., earnings yield.

The Defensive Nature of High Dividend Yields During Market Declines: High 
Dividend Yield Stocks Outperformed other Value Strategies and the Market on 
Average in Down Market Quarters from 1970 – 1996 
In another study, entitled “When The Bear Growls: Bear Market Returns 1970-1996,” 
contained in Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation, David Dreman, 
in collaboration with Eric Lufkin, examined the effectiveness of contrarian value strategies 
in down market quarters for the 27 years ended December 31, 1996.  The Compustat 1500 
database (1500 largest publicly traded stocks) was used, and the performance of four value 
strategies ― low price-to-earnings, low price-to-book value, low price-to-cash flow, and 
high dividend yields ― were measured and averaged for all down quarters and then 
compared to the index itself for the 27-year period.  All of the value strategies 
outperformed the market, with the high dividend strategy (low price-to-dividend) 
performing the best of all the value strategies, declining on average only 3.8%, or roughly 
one-half as much as the market. 
 
 
 
When both the up and down quarters were considered over the full 27 years, again, all of 
the value strategies outperformed the market, but the price-to-dividend strategy trailed the 
other strategies somewhat.  For the full 27-year period, through both up and down 
quarters, the price-to-dividend strategy produced an annualized return of 16.1% versus 
14.9% for the market.

INVESTING WITH THE INNER CIRCLE: 
BUYING STOCKS WHERE TH E INSIDERS (OFFICERS, 
DIRECTORS OR THE COMPANY ITSELF) ARE BUYING 
The Impact of Insider Accumulation 
Investment returns associated with purchases of shares by corporate insiders (officers, 
directors or very large shareholders) have been examined in several studies by 
academicians. All of the studies assume that investments were made in the shares of 
companies in which (i) more than one insider had purchased a company's shares, and (ii) the 
number of insider purchases had significantly exceeded the number of insider sales during 
the same period. The studies also assumed that investments were made in the stocks that 
insiders had purchased shortly after it was public information that the insider transactions 
had occurred. The studies which are referred to in Table 30 are:

State University, 1964;

In Tweedy, Browne's experience, officers, directors and large shareholders often buy their 
own company's stock when it is depressed in relation to the current value which would be 
ascribable to the company's assets or its ongoing business in a corporate acquisition, or to 
the likely value of the company in the near to intermediate future. Insiders often have 
“insight information” — knowledge about  new marketing programs, product price 
increases, cost cuts, increased order rates, changes in industry conditions, etc. which they 
believe will result in an increase in the true underlying value of the company. Other 
examples of insider insights are: knowledge of the true value of “hidden assets,” such as the 
value of a money-losing subsidiary that a competitor may have offered to buy; or the value 
of excess real estate not required in a company's operation; or knowledge of the likely 
earning power of the company once heavy non-recurring new product development costs 
stop. It is not uncommon to see significant insider buying in companies selling in the stock 
market at low price/earnings ratios or at low prices in relation to book value.  
United Kingdom: The Impact of Insider Accumulation 
Mervyn King and Aisla Roell from the London School of Economics examined the 
relationship between overall market returns and returns on U.K. stocks that had been 
purchased by a company's own officers and directors. The study sample consisted of 
companies reported in the weekly “Shares Stakes” section of The Financial Times between 
January 1986 and August 1987 in which an open market purchase had been made by a 
company insider. The study assumed that the same number of shares that had been 
purchased by an insider were acquired for the “Buy” portfolio at the stock price on the day 
of publication. The investment returns in excess of The Financial Times-Actuaries All Share 
Index were computed over periods of one month, three months and one year following the 
publication date. Table 31 shows the results.

Canada: The Impact of Insider Accumulation 
Jerome Baesel and Garry Stein from the University of California, Irvine and Canadian Bank 
of Commerce, respectively, examined the relationship between Canadian stocks listed on 
the Toronto Stock Exchange and purchased by insiders, and investment returns in “The 
Value of Information: Inferences from the Profitability of Insider Trading”, Journal of 
Financial and Quantitative Analysis, September 1979. The authors examined insider 
transactions pertaining to 111 large Toronto Stock Exchange listed industrial firms be-
tween January 1968 and December 1972. The sample consisted of 403 trades by all 
officers or directors who were also directors of a Canadian bank and 580 trades by officers 
and directors who were not directors of a Canadian bank. The study did not examine, as a 
separate category, the investment results from insider purchases of stocks in which the 
insider buying intensity was greatest, (e.g., companies in which three or more insiders had 
purchased shares, or companies in which the insider purchases significantly increased the 
insiders' holdings and represented a large amount of money).  
The authors found that insiders who were also directors of a Canadian bank had an average 
excess return above a risk adjusted market index of 7.8% per year. The excess return for 
officers and directors who were not also directors of a Canadian bank was 3.8% per year.  
Companies that Buy Their Own Stock 
Fortune Magazine, in “Beating the Market by Buying Back Stock,” by Carol Loomis, 
April 29, 1985, examined the investment returns from a strategy of buying the stock of 
companies which have repurchased significant amounts of their own common stock. 
Fortune screened the 1,660 stocks in the Value Line Investment Survey and selected all 
companies which had purchased significant amounts of their own shares in the 10-year 
period from 1974 through 1983. (Companies which had purchased a large quantity of stock 
to eliminate a shareholder who had threatened a takeover were deleted from the sample.) 
Investments were assumed to have been made on the approximate date of each stock 
repurchase. The total investment return was measured from each of these dates to the end 
of 1984, producing a 22.6% average compounded rate of return. The comparable return 
earned on the S&P 500 was 14.1%.  
It has been Tweedy, Browne's experience that a company will often repurchase its own 
shares when its management believes that the shares are worth significantly more than the 
stock price. Share repurchases at discounts to underlying value will increase the per share 
value of the company for the remaining shareholders. When officers and directors are 
significant shareholders, the money which the company uses to buy back its own stock is, to 
a significant extent, the officers’ and directors’ own money. In this circumstance, the 
repurchase of stock by the company is similar to insider purchases.

Companies selling in the stock market at low price/earnings ratios or low prices in relation 
to book value frequently repurchase their own shares. Share repurchases at a pre-tax 
earnings yield which exceeds what the company earns on its cash or what it pays on debt 
incurred to fund the share repurchase will result in an increase in earnings per share. Share 
repurchases at less than book value increase the per share book value of the remaining shares. 
STOCKS THAT HAVE DECLINED IN PRICE 
Stocks with the Worst Prior Investment Results 
Werner F.M. DeBondt and Richard Thaler, Professors at the University of Wisconsin and 
Cornell University, respectively, examined the investment performance of stocks with the 
worst and best prior investment results in “Does the Stock Market Overreact?,” The 
Journal of Finance, July 1985.  
On December 31, 1932, and on each December 31 thereafter through 1977, DeBondt and 
Thaler selected from all stocks listed on the NYSE, a total of 46 separate experiments, the 
35 worst performing and 35 best performing stocks over the preceding five years. For the 
worst performing stocks the average price decline was 45%. The investment results of the 
worst performing and best performing stocks were compared to a market index, the equal 
weighted investment results of all stocks listed on the NYSE. The worst performing stocks 
over the preceding five-year period produced average cumulative returns of 18% in excess 
of the market index 17 months after portfolio formation, a compound annual return in 
excess of the market index of 12.2%. The best performing stocks over the preceding five 
years produced average cumulative returns of about 6% less than the market index after 17 
months, a compounded annual negative return of -4.3% versus the market index.  
DeBondt and Thaler also tested portfolios of worst and best performing stocks based on 
investment returns over the prior three years and found similar significant excess positive 
returns for the worst performing stocks and similar below market returns for the best 
performing stocks.  
Stocks with the Worst Prior Investment Results Throughout the World 
James M. Poterba and Lawrence H. Summers, Professors at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and Harvard University, respectively, examined in their study, “Mean 
Reversion in Stock Prices, Evidence and Implications,” March 1988, whether investment 
results throughout the world tend to move toward an average return, with large increases 
in prices and returns followed by lower or negative returns, and large declines in prices and 
returns followed by positive investment returns. The authors analyzed monthly NYSE

returns from 1926 through 1985, annual NYSE returns from 1981 to 1985, and monthly 
returns for 17 stock markets outside the U.S. from 1957 through 1986. The following stock 
markets outside the U.S. were examined: 
Austria France Netherlands Spai n
Belgium German y Norwa y Sweden
Canada Indi a Philippines Switzerland 
Colombia Japan South Afric a United Kingdom 
Finland 
The Canadian data consisted of monthly capital gains on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Monthly returns, including dividends, on the Financial Times-Actuaries Share Price Index 
were used for the U.K. For the 15 other stock markets, monthly returns from the 
International Monetary Fund’s International Statistics were examined. 
The authors concluded that stock returns throughout the world tend to revert toward a 
mean average return over longer periods of time, i.e., more than one year. Current high 
investment returns tend to be associated with lower investment returns in the future. 
Current low investment returns tend to be associated with higher investment returns in the 
future. The authors suggest the desirability throughout the world of investment strategies 
involving the purchase of shares whose prices have declined significantly.

from the beginning of 1973 through 1982 (about 10 years total) were compared to the 
thirty stocks with the best investment results over the same period and to the overall stock 
market. The thirty worst and best performing stocks over the period 1973 through 1982

Marc Reinganum, in “Portfolio Strategies Based on Market Capitalization,” The Journal of 
Portfolio Management, Winter 1983, studied the investment returns of all stocks listed 
on the NYSE and AMEX from 1963 through 1980. All companies listed on the two stock 
exchanges were ranked according to market capitalization and sorted into deciles at the 
beginning of each year from 1963 through 1980. Table 33, on the next page, shows the 
mean average annual returns, not the compound rates of return, for each of the ten market 
capitalization groups, as well as the cumulative value of $1 invested in each group from 
1963 through 1980, and descriptive information concerning each decile.

INTERRELATED INVESTMENT CHARACTERISTICS  
Donald Keim, Professor of Finance at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 
examined the interrelationship among price/book value, market capitalization, 
price/earnings ratio and average stock price for all NYSE listed companies from 1964 
through 1982 in Stock Market Anomalies, edited by Elroy Dimson, Cambridge University 
Press, 1988.  Each March 31 from 1964 through 1982, all NYSE listed companies were 
ranked according to price in relation to book value and sorted into deciles.  The average 
price/book value ratio, average market capitalization, average price/earnings ratio and 
average price per share were computed for each of the ten groups of companies. The

March 31, 1951 to December 31, 1986 for all New York and AMEX listed companies with 
a December 31 fiscal year, including all such companies which had been sold, merged or 
declared bankrupt. Each March 31, all of the culled companies were ranked according to 
price/earnings ratio and sorted into deciles.  The annual investment return, average

WHAT HAS WORKED IN INVESTING

CONCLUSION 
Most studies which have examined the relationship between investment returns and 
investment characteristics such as price-to-book value, price-to-earnings, price-to-cash 
flow, dividend yield, market capitalization, insider purchases, or company share 
repurchases have compared the relationship between only one investment characteristic and 
subsequent returns. Occasionally, two investment characteristics, such as price-to-book 
value and market capitalization, or price-to-earnings and market capitalization have been 
examined in relation to returns.  
In more than one study, we noted that investments screened for one of the characteristics 
had several of the others, which corresponded to Tweedy, Browne's own investment 
experience. Companies selling at low prices in relation to net current assets, book value 
and/or earnings often have many of the other characteristics associated with excess return. 
Current earnings are often depressed in relation to prior levels of earnings, especially for 
companies priced below book value. The price is frequently low relative to cash flow, and 
the dividend yield is often high. More often than not the stock price has declined 
significantly from prior levels. The market capitalization of the company may be relatively 
small. Corporate officers, directors and other insiders often have been accumulating the 
company’s stock. Frequently, the company itself has been repurchasing its shares in the 
open market. Furthermore, these companies are often priced in the stock market at 
discounts to real world estimates of the value that shareholders would receive in a sale or 
liquidation of the entire company. Each characteristic seems somewhat analogous to one 
piece of a mosaic. When several of the pieces are arranged together, the picture can be 
clearly seen: an undervalued stock.  
In all of the preceding studies, there was a correlation between the investment criterion or 
characteristic and excess return. In most of the studies, the return information presented 
was a single average annual percentage return figure which summarized the investment 
results over a very long measurement period (54 years in the case of Rolf Banz’s study of 
small capitalization stocks).  This summary average annual return figure encompassed, and 
was mathematically determined by, the separate investment returns of the many smaller 
periods of time which comprised the entire length of time of each study. The studies, with 
one exception, did not present information or conclusions concerning the pattern, sequence 
or consistency of investment returns over the shorter subset periods of time which 
comprised the entire measurement period. Questions such as whether the excess returns 
were generated in 50% of the years, or 30% of the years, or in a seven year “run” of 
outperformance followed by seven “dry years” of underperformance, or whether the excess 
returns were produced primarily in advancing or declining stock markets were only 
addressed in one study, “Contrarian Investment, Extrapolation and Risk,” by Professors 
Lakonishok, Vishny and Shleifer.  Their study, over the 1968 through 1990 period,

indicated fairly consistent results over 1-year holding periods, and increasingly consistent 
results over 3-year and 5-year holding periods for low price-to-book value and low price-
to-cash flow stocks, as their performance edge accumulated with the passage of time. This 
performance edge was attained through outperformance in the months when the stock 
market was declining, which was 43% of the 22-year period, and in the months when the 
stock market had its largest percentage advances, which was 10% of the entire period.  
In Tweedy, Browne’s experience, contrary to some proponents of the efficient market 
theory, it is possible to invest in publicly traded companies at prices which are significantly 
less than the underlying value of the companies' assets or business. Two very plain examples 
of undervaluation are: a closed-end mutual fund whose share price is significantly less than 
the underlying market value of its investment portfolio, or a company whose shares are 
priced at a large discount to the company's cash after the deduction of all liabilities. These 
types of easy-to-understand bargains do appear in the stock market recurrently. However, 
it cannot be said with certainty that a clear-cut bargain investment will produce excess 
investment returns, and it is impossible to predict the pattern, sequence or consistency of 
investment returns for a particular bargain investment. It can only be stated with certainty 
that many studies have repeatedly shown investment in numerous groups of bargain 
securities over very long multi-year periods has produced excess returns.  
The managing directors of Tweedy, Browne have always been fascinated by studies which 
have examined the correlation between securities possessing a common characteristic, or 
combination of characteristics, and investment returns. Unlike science, where two parts 
hydrogen and one part oxygen always produce water, the managing directors do not believe 
there is an investment formula that always produces an exceptional return over every 
period of time. Investment returns, and likely favorable or unfavorable perceptions of 
progress on the part of many investors, have tended to vary greatly over periods of time 
that are quite long by human standards, but probably too short in terms of statistical 
measurement validity. However, as this paper has indicated, there have been recurring and 
often interrelated patterns of investment success over very long periods of time, and we 
believe that helpful perspective and, occasionally, patience and perseverance, are provided 
by an awareness of these patterns.  
Tweedy, Browne believes it is likely that many of the investments which will generate 
exceptional rates of return in the future, over long measurement periods, will possess one 
or several of the characteristics which have previously been associated with exceptional 
returns. Tweedy, Browne intends to continue to do its best to keep its clients’ portfolios 
and the managing directors’ own portfolios “well stocked” with investments possessing 
these characteristics.
