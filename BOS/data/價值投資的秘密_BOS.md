This is Paul Chen.
I have since left my full-time job and is now doing 
what I love to do everyday, cycling and value investing.
I spend at least 4 days in a week cycling and just 
enjoying the freedom that I managed to achieve. 
“Working” is now imparting my knowledge to like-
minded people on value investing through my 
involvement with Value Investing College.
But life wasn’t like this before. In fact, I have no 
formal financial background in school as I was trained 
in Engineering. I was completely fed up with my 
regional-travelling job in the telecommunication 
industry because majority of the time, i had to travel 
with little advanced notice and was always away from 
his friends and family. It was then that I decided that I 
had to do something about it.

I know you probably may be skeptical about it. How 
is it even possible? The thing is, financial freedom isn’t 
about having millions of dollars. It’s rather being able 
to have enough income that exceeds your monthly 
expenses.
In other words, to be able to achieve financial freedom 
and retire, your passive income must be more than 
your monthly expenses.
We mostly have Active Income and that means the 
income we get as a result of actively working. But we 
must build up another type of income called Passive 
Income and this simply means income that you don’t 
have to actively work to get.
Here’s 3 reasons how i managed to retire and achieve 
financial freedom in a relatively short span of time:
1. I Pay Myself First
Paying myself first means that i set aside how much 
i want to save every single month instead of the 
reverse. You see, most people will normally decide on 
how much to save only after they spend away their 
monthly salary. However, I sets aside a fixed sum every 
single month. It’ll automatically be deducted from my 
income into a separate account so i won’t touch it at 
all.

我們通常都會有工作的收入d但是我們也要建立自己的被動收
入d也就是說d就算你不用工作d也可以賺到錢f
我這裡分享為什麼我在相對短的時間內d能夠達到財富自由j
1. 先付錢給自己
這句話是說d我先決定每個月要存多少錢d而不是花完的時候
再把剩餘的錢存起來 f很多人拿到薪水的時候 d很容易亂花
錢d花剩下的錢d才會存起來f但是如果我先設定好每個月要
存多少錢d並且請銀行自動轉帳到我另外一個戶頭d這樣我就
能讓這筆錢不會花掉f
2. 教育自己
剛開始d我對於金融和投資完全不懂f當我讀完羅伯特g清崎
的富爸爸窮爸爸這本書後f從那時候開始d我連續上了很
多投資課程d也順便修了一個企管碩士d為了學習好的公司是
如何運作的f因為我對於投資完全沒有概念d所以我尋找有經
驗的人學習d有可以學習的榜樣d對我來說是很重要的d因為
我不需要自己解決每個問題f犯錯的代價很大d所以我想要花
更少的成本d從別人的錯誤經驗中學習f
3. 跟志同道合的人在一起
如果我想要更快的達到財富上的自由d我需要跟我目標一樣的
人在一起d或是跟已經達成財富自由的人在一起f我跟志同道
合的人混在一起d就更容易讓我找到新的點子和好的機會d一
個人就沒辦法找到那麼多的資訊f

2. Buying at a undervalue price
Warren Buffett is famous at looking for deals where 
he can “pay 50 cents for 1 dollar worth”. These 
opportunities only come about when you have 2 skills. 
Firstly, the skill to evaluate what is the value or worth 
of the deal. And Secondly, the ability to react when 
this opportunity present itself to you. So it all boils 
down to doing your homework. Keep reading up on 
good companies that you are interested to invest in 
and have an idea how much you are willing to pay 
for it. When Mr Market present you with a irresistible 
offer, take advantage of it. By investing this way, you 
make money already when you buy (because it is 
undervalue), not when you Sell!
3. Holding it for a long long time
The 3rd step of the formula is usually the simplest but 
hardest step to follow. This is because it involves our 
human emotions and psychology. Human beings are 
accustomed to the concept of instant gratification; 
the desire to experience pleasure or fulfillment 
without delay or deferment. They way to create 
immense wealth in value investing is to hold the good 
business that you have bought at a undervalued 
priced and hold it for a long long time. This involved 
the appreciation of delayed gratification; the ability 
to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and 
wait for a later (usually bigger) reward.

Why delay gratification works for value investing? 
Albert Einstein once said “ Compound Interest is the 
8th wonder of the world”. The value of compounding 
returns together with the ability of good businesses to 
grow year after year makes delayed gratification the 
single most powerful mindset in value investing.
FAVORITE INVESTMENT QUOTE
    
“You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with 
you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right.” 
- Benjamin Graham
This quotation is often interpreted as a statement for 
contrarian theory but to me, what is more important 
is; in investing, we have to stick to our logic and 
reasoning and not be swayed by others who may 
agree or disagree with you. This does not mean we 
blindly follow our believes and ignore other’s opinion, 
but it means we have to constantly go back to our 
data and reasoning on why we want to own a certain 
business at a certain price.

所以你必須要做功課d繼續關注那些你有興趣的公司d讓你知
道自己願意花多少錢投資f當市場先生給你好的機會時d就要
好好把握l當有這樣的投資機會d你一買就算是賺錢了d而不
是賣掉才開始賺錢l
3. 持有股票很久
第三個步驟最簡單d但也是最不容易的步驟f因為跟我們人類
的情緒和心理學有關係 f人類很喜歡及時行樂 d想要立刻享
受d但是如果你想用價值投資創造財富d你就必須持有股票很
久的一段時間f你必須要延遲享受d克制自己不要立刻享受d
才能得到未來更大的獎勵f
為什麼價值投資需要延遲享受k因為愛因斯坦曾經這樣說過j
複利是世界的 8 個奇蹟f用複利的力量d可以讓好的公
司年年成長d延遲享受d是價值投資最有威力的思維f

你之所以會對，是因為數據和推理是對的。
- 班傑明．葛拉漢
這句話常被一些理念不同的人拿來用d但是對我來說d比較重
要的是d在投資的時候d我們要用自己的邏輯和推理去思考d
而不要被人家的意見左右f但這不代表我們完全只聽自己的d
而忽略別人的意見d而是我們必須要理性且客觀的判斷d去想

BACKGROUND STORY
At the age of 15, one of my secondary school
classmates lend a book name “Rich Dad Poor Dad” to 
me. He mentioned that this book really helps him to 
see money in a different way.
After I read the book, I totally agree with what the 
book says about the rat race, passive income and 
financial freedom. I started to observe people around 
me and realised that most people in the world are 
truly trap in the rat race. I am so lucky that my 
mother’s background is similar to the character in the 
book that achieves financial freedom. And my mother 
achieves her financial freedom at her age of 50.
Based on my observations of people receiving passive 
income, the only way to get passive income is to either 
own businesses or by investing. Moreover, from what I 
research in the forbes website, most of the billionaires 
are businessman, an investor or both.
Since then, I know that if I want to get rich or financial 
freedom, investment is a must for me, and it is not a 
choice of whether I like it or not.
So at the age of 15, I started to educate myself on 
stock investments. I start to read a lot of investment

related books and articles to upgrade my knowledge 
towards investment in stocks.
The reason why I learn about stocks investments 
instead of other types of investments is because stock 
investments require much lower capital to start with, 
compare to other types of investments.
During 15 to 18 years old, I have been working part 
time and saving up for stocks investments. By the 
age of 18, I managed to save up about $5,000 which I 
used to start my investment journey. I still remember 
the month I turned 18, I went to opened a brokerage 
account to invest in stocks.
Before buying my first stocks, I attended courses in 
trading. After attending the courses, I was very active 
in the stock market. Almost every week, I would buy 
and sell something. I did this for about a year and felt 
that it was not the something I am looking for.
I do profit from the stock market but the profits were 
not consistent. Moreover, It require me to spend a lot 
of time monitoring my stocks.

in the long run therefore I explore into other types of 
investments in the stock market. After which I found 
value investing methodology, which is what Warren 
buffet himself has been using throughout the years. I 
started exploring in value investing and I found Sean 
Seah's course which is teaching this method. I signed 
up for the course because I want to learn practical 
skills of value investing and not learning from the 
books or internet. Another reason I signed up the 
course is because they also taught value investing 
using stock options which is very attractive.
After learning value investing, I become more 
confident in stock investment. Because I see myself as 
a business collector and I know what businesses I am 
holding rather than just focusing on the daily stock 
prices.
After which The first stock I bought is a country index 
exchange traded fund(ETF). Within 6 months, the 
stock’s value grew by 15% and I was blown away by 
the results. Since then, I gain more confident and faith

that I always wanted to own at a sensible price.
Stock Market is always irrational and illogical in the 
short run and this creates a big opportunity for 
people who have a game plan in the stock market. 
Because we know that in the long run, stock price will 
eventually matches the value of the company.
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS OF VALUE INVESTING
For me, one of the most important concepts of
Value investing is having a reasonable amount of 
“margin of safety” for our “entry price”. This is because 
every one of us may have error in calculating the 
value of the company. Having a reasonable amount of 
“margin of safety” will definitely lower of our risk by 
allowing us to have a bigger discount in calculating 
the value of the company. Once we take care of the 
downside, the upside will take care for itself.
Another important factor during stock investment 
is diversification. We need to slowly build a strong 
portfolio that contain basket of profitable stocks. 
Many times I received news that someone being 
over confident in just one business and invest most 
of their money in that particular business. And once 
the business fail, their whole investments will be hit. 
Diversification is definitely another way to reduce risk

in investing.
The whole analogy of value investing is always reduce 
risk, reduce risk and reduce risk. For example, we 
reduce risk by buying a profitable company, reduce 
risk by buying it at a sensible price, reduce risk by 
building up a basket of stocks and many more. We 
cannot control whether the stock price will go up or 
down tomorrow but we can definitely reduce our risk 
of investment right now. Once we take care of the 
down side, the upside will take care of itself.
FAVOURITE INVESTMENT QUOTE
“Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing."
-Warren Buffett
Up till today, many people have come to me and 
mentioned that stock investing is very dangerous and 
risky. And these are the same group of people who 
blindly invest in the stock market based on rumours 
and hearsay resulted in having bad experiences in the 
stock market.
Whenever I thought of this, I feel really pity for them. 
If they were to invest in themselves in learning how 
to invest in the stock market, they will not think that 
stock market is a dangerous place.

Let me give you an example, if you have a driving 
license and you are driving on the road, you will not 
think that driving is dangerous or risky. Because you 
have learnt how to drive a car and you know what you 
are doing.
On the other hand, if you do not have a driving license 
and have not learn driving at all, driving on the road is 
definitely dangerous and risky for you.
I hope that more people will be able to educate 
themselves before investing in stock market. Only 
then, stock market is a place for you.
WHY DO I WANT TO INVEST?
To me, investment is not a choice, it is a need. We 
need to invest to keep up with the rising cost of living 
due to inflation. A good example is that a 4 room HDB 
flat in Singapore that cost around SGD$60,000 in 
1980s now (2016) has risen to about SGD$500,000. It 
is has risen about 8 times in about 30 years period.
This means that if we did not start to invest back then, 
our purchasing power will drop by around 8 times. 
This numbers is indeed alarming.
 
Another reason why I want to invest is that it is one

When the downturn hit in 2008, I was hit hard. Many of my 
investments lost money, as did the investments of people 
around the world. After going back and looking at my 
purchases, I realised that the stock purchases made using 
technical analysis and other techniques lost me the most 
money, while the stocks that I had purchased using value 
investment recovered after the downturn. The advantages 
of using value investing was apparent.
Value investing became my primary method of investing.

INVESTING CURIOSITY
I did not come from a wealthy family. My life has 
changed for the better because of value investing.
When I was a child, my father invested in stocks on the 
advice of a friend, and lost of a lot of money. Stung by 
the stock market, my parents tried to warn me of the 
dangers of the stock market from an early age. To this 
day, they have stayed away from investing.
However, this seemed to have an opposite effect on 
me — I became very interested in investing. I wanted 
to give my family a better life, and I knew that I 
wouldn’t be able to do this with a normal job and 
normal salary. I saw only two routes that I could take: 
entrepreneurship and investment. I decided to take 
both of them.
In university, I studied mechanical engineering, but 
I would often sit in on finance and business classes. 
I would study finance magazines and record the 
stocks that they recommended. I attended classes on 
investing. I would buy any and all finance books that I 
came across. During that period of my 
life, I must have purchased over 100 investment books.
I came across both fundamental and technical 
analysis as I read financial magazines and books. As I

of and used, but not exclusively. For example, the first 
stock I ever purchased was that of a steel company, 
because it was somewhat related to my engineering 
background. I had read a quote by Warren Buffett, 
“Never invest in a business you cannot understand,” 
Warren Buffett said. I took that to heart. Despite 
Taiwan’s tech roots and the abundance of tech 
companies in Taiwan’s stock market, I avoided them 
because Warren Buffett did.
THE TURN TO VALUE INVESTING
When the downturn hit in 2008, I was hit hard. Many 
of my investments lost money, as did the investments 
of people around the world. After going back and 
looking at my purchases, I realised that the stock 
purchases made using technical analysis and other 
techniques lost me the most money, while the stocks

investing was apparent. Value investing became my

THE MUTUAL INFLUENCE OF
INVESTING AND BUSINESS
I consider myself both an entrepreneur and an investor. 
I started my first company, GoBox, after graduating 
from university. It expanded from a tutoring side gig to 
an education company with over 30 franchises around 
Taiwan. I was able to start that company because of 
my investing knowledge. I was able to earn a little bit 
of money from investing, and that is the money that I 
used to start my first business.
In business, cashflow is king, and knowing how 
money works helped me manage the cashflow of my 
business. I’m proud to say that all 3 of the businesses 
I started are still around today, though 2 of them have 
changed hands and changed names.
 
My experience with business also affected how I look 
at investing. After putting a lot of heart into each 
of the businesses that I started, I wanted them to 
continue to provide value for a long time. I started 
to make a connection between the businesses that

I was running and the stocks that I was holding. No 
matter how good the returns of a company are, if the 
company is short-sighted or has poor management, it 
will hurt the company sooner or later. A good stock is 
a good business.
My experiences have taught me that a firm grasp of 
money management can help me reach my goals 
more quickly. This is why my current company teaches 
kids about money. I believe the earlier kids learn about 
money and the rules of the money game, the faster 
they can make their mark on the world. They will reach 
their goals more quickly, and can contribute their gifts 
to the world. A child’s understanding about money 
will affect their habits, and these habits is a big driving 
force in their lives. My mission is to continue to learn 
about money and investing, and for me to educate the 
next generation.
THE IMPORTANCE OF A VALUE INVESTMENT
SYSTEM THAT YOU NEVER SELL
Many people see investing as a way to earn some 
cash in the short-term. People will try to buy a stock 
when it is up, and sell a stock when it is down. But 
what is the next step? Many will then take some or all 
of the money out of the stock market for other uses.

using compound interest to your advantage.
It is important to reinvest the money that you earn 
in the stock market, no matter the form. Do you get 
dividends from a great stock? Reinvest. Did you earn 
money from selling options? Reinvest. Reinvesting 
allows your money to harness the full potential of 
compound interest, the most powerful force in the 
world. As Warren Buffett says, “Life is like a snowball. 
The important thing is finding wet snow and a really 
long hill.”
When you keep your money in the stock market, it 
does not mean you just keep it in one particular stock. 
You still need to move, monitor and manage it, and 
the easiest way to do that is with a value investment 
system. Here is the easiest 3-step system for making 
your stocks work for you in the long term.
STEP 1 : SET UP A SHOPPING LIST AND PURCHASE 
GOOD ASSETS
Make a shopping list or a watch list of good stocks. 
Remember that you are looking for stocks (or good 
underlying businesses) that you can hold for at least 
10 years and hopefully a lifetime.
Has the company been around for a long time, 
fulfils a need and is managed well? Do you foresee

STEP 3: LET YOUR ASSETS GROW WITH COMPOUND 
INTEREST
If you have completed the first two steps, then the 
third component you need is time. Time is your best 
friend. The longer that you invest, the more time that 
compound interest has time to accumulate on your 
investments.
Remember to monitor your assets. When a stock has 
become over valued by the market, instead of selling 
and taking money out of the system, use the money 
to purchase an under-valued stock. Go back to your 
shopping list to find the right undervalued stock.
Remember a good asset is just like a good student. 
Good students usually get good grades at school. 
Yet no matter how good the student, they may 
perform poorly on a single particular assignment or 
test. However, overall the good student is still likely 
to perform well in the future. When we have our 
shopping list of good-student stocks, but it is under-
performing now, it is just a matter of time before they 
are back to getting good grades. By reinvesting the 
profits, we will allow the power of compound interest 
to work even more.

BEWARE SHORT-SIGHTED INVESTING
How is picking stocks different than picking a roulette 
number? Roulette is a pure probability game, whereas 
investing is not. The probability of landing on any 
number of the roulette wheel is the same, whereas the 
probability of each stock excelling is not the same. 
This is because behind every stock is a company with 
managers, product lines, and customers. A company 
may perform well for a short term because of luck, but 
a company often performs in the long run because 
of good business reasons, whether they are well run, 
have a good product, or have good management. 
This is why we need to understand the companies 
themselves, and not just a technical analysis of the 
probability that a stock will rise and fall.

Mr. Market is an emotional unstable entity. If you 
are investing in the short- term, then it is always 
dangerous to invest. 
You may make a little bit of money at the beginning,

When you look at stocks from a value investing 
perspective, you see stocks as a lifetime business. 
This is the only way to stand on the same side as Mr.

INVESTING IN MY OWN EDUCATION

Before I learned about value investing, I thought that 
investing was about beating the market. I thought that 
I could do analysis and beat the market. I would need 
to spend a lot of time analyzing to get slightly above- 
average returns, but as soon as I got distracted, I lost 
money. I thought that I was playing the market, but 
instead, the market was playing me.

they become interested in investing — but this is a

we may become easily influenced by others and the

Value investment teaches us to take the long view, and 
to focus on the real value that businesses are creating 
in the world. Value investing has allowed me to gain 
perspective in my own businesses. I am more focused 
on long- term returns, rather than short-term profits. I 
have found with value investing, my returns have been 
more stable and I am able to spend time on other 
things in my life. This is the life that I want.
We need to be aware of our goals, why we want to 
earn money and the motivation behind it. That is the

PERFORMANCE BASED ON VALUE INVESTING
In the past, I used to think that investing was some 
sort of profound mystery. I thought that if someone 
invests in stocks, they need to spend a lot of time 
checking the stock price, and most of the time they 
still lose money. In the end, a lot of people lose all 
of their personal assets and have to pay back debt. 
I thought that a lot of money was need to begin 
investing, and that it was definitely not for young 
graduates who had just joined the workforce.
However, I have learned that sustainability is the 
reason why value investing is so powerful. The mindset 
of holding stocks long-term and not paying attention 
to price volatility attracts me deeply. I have learned to 
have faith in good companies, to use good prices to 
buy and to hold good stocks.
Ever since I adapted the value investing strategy, my 
annual return on US stocks have exceeded 25%. Now I 
am happy and confident about my financials.
I think to myself, “if I can continue this track record, 
wouldn’t I surpass Buffett?”  Buffett has consistently 
achieved an annual compound rate of 19.7% for 50 
years. As long as I achieve stable returns of 19.7%,

Working as a pharmacist is difficult.  We worked 
in the hospital for the maximum hours allowed by 
law. We don’t have fixed working hours, so it takes 
a lot of effort each day just to record our hours on 
duty. Our salary was not bad compared to other 
jobs, but we would still spend more than half of it on 
living expenses.  Even if we tried to live a very frugal 
lifestyle, we only managed to save a bit of money 
because of our expensive hobbies.  A camera that 
cost tens of thousands, wedding expenses, trips to 
Japan and other countries, extra courses to sharpen 
our skills at work and more.  These different expenses 
made my savings account roller coaster up and down.

by age 65 and live to 80. Altogether, my husband and 
I felt very insecure about money, which led to endless 
fights. We were even considering a divorce.
 
If you have only a single source of income, your bank 
account will look like a roller coaster.
 
We decided to attend a finance class to learn more 
about money. The funny thing was, after the first 
day of class, instead of applying what we learned, 
we argued until five o’clock in the morning about 
our different points of view on money. My husband 
thought I was a poor manager of our finances. He 
wanted to know why after working full-time for a few 
years, I was unable to save very much.
We still attended class the next day, and that’s why 
things become more fun. The lecturer taught us 
about all kinds of financial products available in the 
market, such as real estate, funds, gold, stocks, bonds, 
etc.  Lastly, we were introduced to the world of US 
stocks.  We learned about how you can steadily make 
15% returns every year with value investing.  We were 
deeply attracted to this concept and went to another 
sharing session hosted by the Value Investing College.

to the fundamentals of investing stocks: shareholders 
are ultimately lending money to management to run 
a company. A good company in nature will increase 
their profits and create more value for shareholders. 
It makes sense to grow your money along with a 
growing economy, and we attend Joshua Lin’s class 
without hesitation. 
As a pharmacist, my best advice to living a healthy life 
is to eat 3 meals a day, sleep adequately, exercise often 
and get rid of other bad habits.  I never recommend 
any magical pills to my patients, because magic pills 
do not exist.  If they did in fact exist, I would be the 
first person to take them. Indeed, I agree with BOS’s 
vision with whole heartedly and highly recommend 
value investing to everyone.
 
TRANSFORMING FROM A PHARMACIST
TO A VALUE INVESTOR 
After class, we started to invest using the principles 
of value investing. Half of our funds were used to buy 
stocks and half of our funds were used in B.O.S.S. 
strategies. Each month, we would make 2 to 5% of 
cash flow passively. Cumulatively, we have now safely 
earned six figures TWD and looking forward to making 
seven figures this year. My husband and I now have a 
better relationship, and we are more confident about

our future. We are more willing to plan for our future 
such as having children, buying houses and so on.  
Our views on money are similar now as well, and our 
wealth has slowly started to accumulate. Moreover, our 
spending habits have changed as well.  We are willing 
to spend less and make more money.  We promise 
each other to spend less money on camera lenses 
and buy more quality stocks. We know the return on 
investing significant. Our money is not just earning 2% 
by sitting in the bank; rather, it is earning 20% using 
value investing. This has completely changed our 
mindset.
Someone once asked me, how much time do I spend 
researching on stocks? That is like asking me how 
much time each day do I act like a pharmacist. The 
answer I give is ‘anytime’.  As a medical professional, 
there is not one second where I am not using my 
abilities. Likewise, I am always pondering different 
companies’ business models, and I am constantly 
looking for a good deal. The information I get from 
researching companies accumulate. The more I study, 
the more experience and knowledge I gain. In contrast, 
the numbers and charts in technical analysis change 
all the time.  Hence, my path to financial freedom gets 
clearer each day with value investing.

ACTUAL RESULTS FROM INVESTING IN US STOCKS
 
I used to think that investing was difficult. I used to 
think it was difficult to explain investing in a clear and 
simple way. Now that I’ve learned how to invest with 
value investing, I understand investing is easy and 
how it deeply relates to our lives.  It's something we 
see and touch every day. Heck, I can find tons of good 
companies just by looking at the medicines I pack 
each day.  I used to think that investing is something 
personal. I used to think it’s something we need to do 
in private and that I can only rely on my own research. 
Now, I see new and seasoned investors every day in 
Buffett Online School. I can look at investing from a 
different perspective, as something to be shared and 
discussed. Students are willing to openly share their 
latest trades and knowledge on various topics.  A

person may walk fast alone, but a group of people will 
travel far. I choose the latter anytime.
I am not worried about my financials anymore.  
However, if I had a time machine, I’d like to go back 
and tell my younger self to learn about value investing 
as soon as possible.  Who knows, maybe I would be 
financially free by now!  In addition to having a better 
lifestyle for myself and my family, I also have a small 
wish I would like to fulfill.  I wish for there to be no 
more stray dogs in the world.  I know there are many 
volunteers out there who choose to live a very poor 
lifestyle so that they can take care of stray dogs. I 
hope that one day I can not only help them financially 
but be able to share the knowledge of value investing 
with them. So that they will no longer have financial 
burdens while serving a greater purpose.  In fact, I 
would like to promote value investing like Ms Mary 
Buffett for the rest of my life. Investing is easy, it only 
takes a leap of faith and a decision to follow the right 
principles.

First Step to Wealth? 
Escaping the Myth 
of‘Price’
“Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” 
- Warren Buffett
Now when I see a nice restaurant, I stop and ask myself 
whether I should go in, or whether I should eat at home, and 
use the money I save to buy a $40 share of Coca-cola.

Before I share my investing tips with you, we need to 
talk about personal values. After all, to plant a healthy 
tree that bears fruit, you must sow seeds with great 
care. You will find many “methods” out there teaching 
you how to make more money. But to me, mindset 
is more important than any method. Specifically, the 
mindset of saving money. To be a good investor, you 
can and need to save money. 
 
A friend of mine often tells me, “any money spent on 
food is money well spent.” Being a lover of good food, 
I was happy to accept this statement as true. For a 
foodie like me, it was like music to my ears. I would 
spend thousands of dollars on food alone. My desire 
for luxury only grew larger. My first $50 bottle of wine 
was enjoyable, but then I tried wine that cost hundreds 
and then thousands of dollars. The $50 bottle of wine 
suddenly became undrinkable. Like many others, I too 
have made some really bad money decisions and have 
squandered my money on useless things. 
Thus, I am not trying to judge anyone who wants to 
live a better lifestyle. However, one day I suddenly 
realized how fragile the lifestyle and the “status” I 
built with money was. No matter how hard I worked, 
a financial crisis like 2008 could easily wipe out my 
lifestyle. I could lose the life that took me years to 
build.

My lifestyle had an insatiable appetite. I started 
to wonder how many years I could keep it afloat. 
I worked hard to earn the income needed for my 
lifestyle, but the fact is, I am unable to sustain this 
work intensity until I am 80 years old. I wonder if I will 
even be able to work until I am  50 or 60 years old.
I thought everything was ok because my salary 
covered my expenses. But this was just a good feeling. 
In fact, my income was not passive, it was my hard-
earned money covered with blood and sweat. I could 
easily buy a nice steak using my salary, but the same 
amount of money would definitely not buy me the 
same steak in 20 years. 
What I needed was a way to truly maintain my 
lifestyle, without wanting to enhance it and spend 
more money.  I didn’t want to stay in this rat race of 
working hard, complaining, wasting my money on 
useless things, then working more to pay for those 
things…
Suddenly, I changed the way I thought. I started to 
use a savings plan to control my desire to buy things.  
I began learning about stock investing. I started to 
enjoy reading about good companies that distribute 
growing dividends to its shareholders.  My views 
towards money changed completely.

“Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” 
- Warren Buffett
Now when I see a nice restaurant, I stop and ask 
myself whether I should go in, or whether I should eat 
at home, and use the money I save to buy a $40 share 
of Coca-cola. I still sometimes decide to walk in to 
the restaurant. But when we look at it from a 20 year 
perspective, it is better to buy a high quality blue chip 
stock in the long run.
Many people believe that the only asset they can own 
is a house. But the concept of saving for 30 years 
to buy a house is outrageous to them, so instead of 
saving money and buying other good assets, they 
simply blame money as evil and spend their money on 
things that make them feel good.
Poor people lack the power to control money. Thus, 
it is money that controls them. Peopleoften complain 
about having no choices. But everyone has a choice.
Self-reflection is one way we can take control of our 
lifeto understand the relationship between price and 
value is another.
In Buffett’s words, this is the best time in history to be

a moderate person. I am not encouraging everyone

However, we are relatively rich compared to many 
other times in history. Some people don’t ask for 
much; they can spend a whole day in a 7-Eleven and 
find everything they need there.
 
Some people complains about how the rich people 
allocating all the resources. They complain about the 
rich and society creating a new generation of so-
called "losers from the beginning." 
We may not have the same privileges as the sons and

worth of a billions of dollars. When he died in 1937, 
his assets were estimated to be worth 390 to 400

wealth was once 2% of entire economy of the United 
State! By comparison, in 2016 Bill Gates' net worth 
was about 80 to 90 billion U.S. dollars. What I wanted 
to say here is that young people should not feel

also able to think independently. Whenever I have the 
urge to buy a can of Coke or a new iPhone, instead of 
consuming, I train myself to see whether I can buy a 
share of Coca-Cola (Symbol: KO) or a share of Apple 
(Symbol: AAPL) instead.  I ask myself, why don’t I 
put on a businessman's hat and grab a slice of some 
world-class companies?
If you can do the same, the next time you go 
shopping, you will be happy when you see other 
people holding that iPhone, because you know they 
are all contributing to your stock income. The point 
is to switch your mindset from that of a consumer to 
the mindset of a business owner, and then understand 
what assets would give you tremendous value in the 
long run.
 
Looking back at my mistakes and the power of long-
term compound interest, I sometimes ask myself, 
“What if I instead of wasting this money and invested 
in high quality assets earlier?”
To make wise decisions consistently is like activating 
the butterfly effect -- a small change made today can 
result in large changes tomorrow." I believe that the 
few, good financial decisions I make today and the 
new financial knowledge I amass today will show their 
value eventually. I'm not in a hurry because my scope

is to hold my stocks for 20-30 years. The compound 
interest I receive will continue to roll and form a nice 
financial snowball. I know the financial snowball will 
only grow larger and larger, and the money I need to 
continue its momentum will decrease.
There are a few things you can do to help yourself.: 
Control your desire to buy things. Do not buy things 
because you think you can afford it, instead buy things 
that you need at an attractive price. Increase the 
amount that you save and buy high-quality dividend 
growth stocks.  If you can do all these, your mindset 
changes. You have opened the door to financial 
freedom and shattered the myth that it’s hard to 
become rich.

When the stock market is hitting new highs, everything

Why would anyone dislike that idea?

At the beginning of 2017, the Taiwan Stocks Weighted 
Index traded at 9,350 points, and the Dow Jones was 
close to 20,000 points. They were both close to the 
so-called “ten-thousand-point ceiling.” 
Experts from newspapers and magazines all said, "This 
is going to be a turbulent year for the stock market. 
The inevitable crash is near. Investors need to invest 
conservatively. Cash is king indeed."
 
Are you going to invest more? Or, are you going to 
sellout and exit? What are the highs and lows in the 
stock market? With your answer in mind, let’s first take 
a look at some history.
SPECULATORS WHO TRIED TO GUESS THE BOTTOM
 
On May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones index was trading at 
40.94. From 1923 to 1929, the stock market became 
extremely active and the Dow Jones index rose 
all the way. On September 3, 1929, it reached the 
highest point of 381 points. The US stock market was 
filled with a sense of prosperity and optimism. No 
one would have expected that only a month later, 
on Monday, October 28th, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average tumbled 12.82% shortly after the opening bell. 
The wealth people have amassed over the years from 
the bull market was wiped out in just a few months.

The stock market disaster, coupled with a series of 
events, eventually led to the Great Depression of the 
United States in the 1930s.
 
In 1929, the return rate of the Dow Jones index was 
-17.17%. It continued to slide the following year and the 
return rate was -33.7%.  You would think that it was 
about time for the dow back up, right?
In 1931, the return rate of the Dow Jones Index was 
-52.67%, which was the biggest drop in history. The 
index fell to 77.9 points.
There is a Chinese saying that says, "The same thing 
will not happen three times." A lot of speculators 
thought the market had reached the bottom after 
dropping for 3 consecutive years.
This was false. The Dow Jones closed at its low of 43 
points on June 30, 1932, with a return rate of -22.64%.
 
It took 33 years for the Dow Jones Index to climb from 
40.94 to nearly 400 points, but it took only 3 years 
for it to fall back to the same place. This is the longest, 
the most influential, and the worst economic recession 
in the 20th century. Speculators who thought "The 
same thing will not happen three times" lost a lot of 
money thinking the market bottomed at the end of

It took another 22 years for Dow Jones to officially go 
back to 400 points in 1954.
SPECULATORS WHO TRIED TO GUESS THE HIGHEST 
POINT
 
The events of 1930 were many years ago. Let's look at 
something closer. In 1990, the Dow Jones Index had 
repeatedly failed to strike 3,000 points. In August of 
the same year, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The Dow fell 21% 
to 2,365 points. However, the war soon came to an 
end. In April 1991, the Dow Jones index rose all the 
way up to 3,000 points, then exceeded 4,000 points

and 5,000 points in 1995.
If you were an investor in 1996, would you dare to 
enter the market after 5 years of bull markets?  Or 
would you take the profit and leave?
For speculators who tried to guess the highest point, 
they might have exited prematurely in 1996. What 
happened in the next 4 years was phenomenal:
 
In October 1996, the Dow Jones index hit 6,000 
points. Should I have taken partial profit?
In February 1997, the Dow Jones Index hit 7,000 
points. Should I have taken more profit?
In July 1997, the Dow Jones index hit 8,000 points. 
Again, should I have taken profit?
In April 1998, the Dow Jones Index hit 9,000 points. 
Do we have any extra stocks to take profit from?
In March 1999, the Dow Jones index hit the 10,000 
mark for the first time.
At the end of 1999, the Dow Jones Index closed at 
11,497 points.
How much equities do speculators have left to take 
profit from at this point in time?
 
Looking back, even if speculators missed the 
opportunity in 1990 (2,365 points giving a 386%

return rate), or 1991 (3,000 points giving a 283% rate 
of return), they would make money still if they dare to 
enter the market in year 1996.  The next four years of 
bull market would still yield them a total of 125%!
 
Of course, haters out there are going to say, ‘the 
Internet bubble in 2000 and the terrorist attack in 
2001 had caused the US stock market to fall for the 
next three years. The market is rigged!”
In fact, the Dow Jones Index reached the bottom at 
7,286 points in 2002. An investor who invested in early 
1996 would still have earned a return rate of nearly 
42%.
In 2003, the Dow Jones index returned to 10,000 
points.
And in January 2018, Dow Jones passed 26,000 
points.

As Benjamin Graham wrote, “In the short run, the 
market is like a voting machine. But in the long run, 
the market is like a weighing machine.”
Burton Malkiel, the author of A Random Walk Down 
Wall Street, mentioned that the stock market moves 
like a "random walk": we cannot predict the future 
stock prices based on the past.
Kostolany, the author of Confessions of a Speculator, 
introduced the famous “master and dog” theorem: A 
dog that running around would stop and return to its 
owner eventually. Just like 2+2=5- 1, the process might 
be different, but the end result is the same.
Value investing is simple. It’s simply finding a great 
company, buying it with a margin of safety, and 
holding it before it goes bad.
There are only 2 key points to a successful, long-term 
investment: a reasonable asset allocation  and a long 
holding period.
Let’s have a look at why most speculators fail from a 
value investor’s perspective. It’s not because of luck, 
and it’s certainly not because of lack of courage. 
The truth is speculators do not know how to judge 
whether a company is good or bad. They are not

aware of the difference between price and value, and 
they do not know what is a reasonable price to buy an 
equity.
As a result, they speculate, make guesses on market 
trends, and trade regularly.
Looking back at the Dow Jones Index, if you ask me 
whether it is high now, I would say, “the market is 
high now, but it’s also low. Truth is, high and low is not 
important at all.”
When it comes to investing, all I care to look for is 
a “good company”, a “margin of safety”, “holding 
period”, “reasonable asset allocation”, and “time 
horizon”.
Now let’s go back to the start of this article.
In 2017, the global market was thriving. The return 
on Taiwan stocks were a whopping 19.6%, and the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average was returning 25.3%. 
Speculators who left early experienceed none of that.
It is 2018 now, and what we hear is the same: "This 
is going to be a turbulent year for the stock market. 
The inevitable crash is near. Investors need to invest 
conservatively. Cash is king indeed."
What are you going to do?
